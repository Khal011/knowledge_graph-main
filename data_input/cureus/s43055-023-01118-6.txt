Abstract 
Background  Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurobehavioural disorder, characterized by abnormal affiliative 
and socio-emotional responses which are generally regulated by certain neuropeptides in the hypothalamus (an 
anatomic component of the ventral diencephalon (VD)). The use of volumetric MRI for studying VD volume change 
could provide a novel approach for identification of structural brain changes in ASD; this could assist in understanding 
the pathophysiology of ASD and would reflect on treatment strategies. The aim of the current work was to investigate 
the role of MRI volumetric analysis of the ventral diencephalon in young children diagnosed with autism spectrum 
disorder.
Methods  Fifty children diagnosed with ASD underwent volumetric brain analysis, on a fully automated MRI brain 
volumetry system (volBrain), with voxel-based morphometry of various segmental structures of the brain includ-
ing the VD, using vol2Brain 1.0 pipeline software analysis suite.
Results  There were 48 out of 50 children who demonstrated abnormal VD volume which was found below the nor-
mal limits compared with reference standard normalized volume. All cases were normocephalic demonstrating nor-
mal intra-cranial cavity volumes. Forty out of fifty cases showed increased total volume of grey matter, and eighteen 
out of fifty cases showed increased total volume of white matter. Regarding the amygdala and hippocampus, there 
were only two cases (4.0%) which showed slightly increased relative volume of the total amygdala, and two other 
cases (4.0%) demonstrated increased relative volume of the total hippocampus. Comparison between the autistic 
patients and normal references revealed a significant difference regarding the VD volume and total volume of grey 
matter, whereas no significant differences were found regarding the white matter amygdala and hippocampus.
Conclusions  Based on the consistent significant volume decrease in the ventral diencephalon in patients with child-
hood autism, this study concluded that volumetric MRI analysis could be useful for diagnosis of childhood spectrum 
disorder and could be utilized as a reliable screening method in the clinically vague cases. Further study with a larger 
sample size including more age groups is recommended for more validation of the results.

Background
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental 
neurobehavioural  disorder characterized by impaired 
social interaction and communication. The global preva-
lence of ASD is increasing with estimated value equal to 
62/10,000 people, and this could further increase among

children suffering from other developmental disorders [1, 
2].
The ventral diencephalon (VD) is defined as a group of 
cerebral structures located ventral to the thalamus. They 
could not be distinguished from each other on stand-
ard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The relevant 
and important VD component that would contribute 
to pathophysiology of ASD is the hypothalamus, and 
it could support and regulate the affiliative and socio-
emotional responses owing to its neuropeptides. Because 
of its small size and the difficulty regarding its delinea-
tion and its volumetric analysis, the studies which are 
concerning with hypothalamic abnormalities in ASD on 
MRI are quite few in contrast to other structures like the 
amygdala and hippocampus [3, 4].
The use of volumetric MRI for studying various brain 
diseases has been widely applied; it has the advantage of 
being non-invasive technique which provides high spatial 
resolution images. The detection of ventral diencepha-
lon volume change using volumetric MRI could provide 
a novel approach for identification of structural brain 
changes which occur in autism; this in turn could assist 
in understanding the pathophysiology of ASD and would 
directly reflect on the treatment strategy alteration such 
as early behavioural interference and individualized ther-
apy [5, 6].
The aim of the current work was to investigate the role 
of MRI volumetric analysis of the ventral diencephalon in 
young children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.
Methods
This observational analytic prospective study was con-
ducted in the MRI unit of our institution from September 
2021 to August 2022 after being approved by the Faculty 
of Medicine Research Ethics Committee. Approval num-
ber was 16:3/2021.
Study participants
Fifty five children aged 3–9 years and formally diagnosed 
with autism spectrum disorder were referred from the 
neuropsychiatric clinic in paediatric department to the 
MRI unit for brain MRI study; five cases of them were 
excluded from the study due to concurrent structural 
brain anomalies found in MRI. The remaining fifty chil-
dren were 40 (80%) males and 10 (20%) females with 
mean age 5.58 ± 1.29 (range was 3–8.5). All fifty patients 
underwent thorough history taking about their cogni-
tive development and behaviour, assessment of language 
abilities, as well as complete medical, neurological and 
hearing examinations. An informed written consent was 
obtained from child’s parents prior to participating in the 
study.
Inclusion criteria
Inclusion criteria for patients were based on formal clini-
cal diagnosis of ASD in a young child aged 3–9  years, 
using in-depth developmental evaluation that was done 
by a trained paediatric neurologist with eight-year expe-
rience in paediatric neurology.
Exclusion criteria
Contraindications to MRI study (as in patients with coch-
lear implant), concurrent congenital heart disease not 
candidate for sedation, older children above 9 years and 
patients with structural brain anomalies were the exclu-
sion criteria.
MRI technique
Conventional MRI study of the brain was performed on 
an Ingenia 1.5 Tesla Philips closed MR scanner using 
head coil. All children were sedated with chloral hydrate 
and immobilized on the table during the study. The fol-
lowing sequences were performed for all cases: Sagit-
tal T1W-3D turbo gradient echo (TR/TE 7.5/3.4  ms, 
matrix 256 × 216, flip angle 8, duration 7:02 min), coro-
nal T2WI (TR/TE 3163/100  ms, matrix 180 × 187, slice 
thickness/gap 5/1 mm, duration 2:10 min), axial FLAIR 
(TR/TE 8000/92  ms, matrix 240 × 143, slice thick-
ness/gap 5/1  mm, duration 3:21  min), axial DWI (TR/
TE 6000/110  ms, matrix 192 × 190, slice thickness/gap 
5/1 mm, duration 1:13 min) and sagittal T1WI (TR/TE 
550/15 ms, matrix 168 × 131, slice thickness/gap 5/1 mm, 
duration 1:35 min).
Image analysis
Five radiologists have assessed the conventional brain 
MRI images independently, and blindly in all cases, their 
experiences in neuroradiology were 25, 15, 10, 9 and 
5 years. Any structural abnormalities or signs of related 
disease/syndrome were reported for exclusion purpose. 
Volumetric analysis of the T1W-3D gradient echo images 
was carried out on a fully automated MRI brain volu-
metry system (volBrain) which employed a voxel-based 
morphometry and segmentation of brain macro-struc-
tures as well as subcortical regions including the limbic 
system and VD, and the used software version was vol-
2Brain 1.0 pipeline software analysis suite (Fig. 1).
Quality control and case validation were done by visual 
assessment of input image quality before uploading to 
volBrain software, and also after the volumetric report 
became ready, a second visual assessment of the pro-
cessed images was performed on volBrain reports which 
provide screenshots of one sagittal, one coronal and one 
axial image. All volumes were presented in absolute val-
ues (measured in ­
cm3) as well as in relative values which

were measured in relation to the intra-cranial cavity vol-
ume (ICV). For reference purpose, the obtained values 
were compared with expected normal limits provided by 
volBrain software that were 95% of normalized volume 
in function of sex and age. The library of constructed 
templates of the vol2Brain software has utilized different 
public brain datasets covering nearly the entire human 
life-span and both sexes (all values outside the limits were 
highlighted in red). The Asymmetry Index is calculated 
as the difference between right and left volumes divided 
by their mean (in per cent) [7].
Statistical analysis
Data analysis was performed using SPSS software, ver-
sion 26. The qualitative data were described as num-
ber and percentage and were analysed by Chi-square 
test. Descriptive statistics of the quantitative data were 
done using Student’s “t” test if normally distributed or

Mann–Whitney U test, and Kruskal–Wallis test if not 
normally distributed. The accepted level of significance 
in this work was started at 0.05. (P < 0.05 was considered 
significant.)
Results
This study was carried out on fifty autistic children, 40 
(80%) males and 10 (20%) females. The mean age of all 
patients was 5.58 ± 1.29 (range was 3–8.5) (Table 1).
There were 48 out of 50 children who demonstrated 
abnormal small ventral diencephalon volume, notably the 
relative volume which was found below the normal limits 
compared with normalized reference volume in function 
of sex and age (mean was 0.58 ± 0.04, and inter-quartile 
range was 0.542–0.614) (Table 2) (Figs. 2 and 3).
All cases were normocephalic; they demonstrated nor-
mal intra-cranial cavity volumes, and no case was catego-
rized as micro- or macro-cephalic. Forty out of fifty cases 
showed increased total volume of grey matter (mean was 
60.19, and inter-quartile range was 59.08–61.19), and 
eighteen out of fifty cases showed increased total volume 
of white matter (mean was 30.27, and inter-quartile range 
was 28.005–31.80). Regarding the major limbic system 
structures (amygdala and hippocampus), there were only 
two cases (4%) which showed increased relative volume 
of the total amygdala above the upper normal limits in 
relation to the intra-cranial cavity volume (mean was 
0.142, and inter-quartile range was 0.136–0.15), whereas 
the remaining cases showed normal values. In addition, 
there were two other cases (4%) which demonstrated 
increased relative volume of the total hippocampus in 
relation to the intra-cranial volume above the upper nor-
mal limits (mean was 0.565, and inter-quartile range was 
0.546–0.589), and the remaining cases showed normal 
relative volumes (Tables 3 and 4) (Figs. 4 and 5).
Comparison between the autistic patients and normal 
references revealed a significant differences regarding 
the VD volume and total volume of grey matter (P value 
was < 0.001), whereas no significant differences were 
found regarding the white matter amygdala, hippocam-
pus, basal ganglia, thalamus and cerebellum (Table 4).
The per cent agreement in the study was excellent 
between the readers, and the inter-reader reliability (IRR) 
was calculated at 98% for the presence or absence of 
structural brain anomalies. The IRR was non-applicable 
regarding the results of vol2Brain charts, as the process 
was fully automated and depended on a standardized 
screenshots of selected images.
Discussion
No single pattern of structural brain abnormality was 
found to be characteristic to ASD patients. Many stud-
ies have evaluated the role of volumetric brain MRI in 
assessment of region-specific structural changes such 
as grey and white matter volumes, in addition to sub-
cortical structures which include the hippocampus and 
amygdala. The majority of studies have yielded conflict-
ing results which varied from increased to decreased and 
even preserved volumes [8–10].
The current study has investigated the volume of ven-
tral diencephalon which is believed to play a role in 
pathophysiology of ASD due to hypothalamic implication 
in socio-emotional and affiliative behaviour in humans.
The main finding in the current study was the consist-
ent relation between ASD children and small volume of 
VD that was found in 48 out of 50 cases; this consistent 
feature appeared to be in the same line with the theory 
of endocrine functional alteration which suggests the 
presence of abnormal hypothalamic hormonal function 
in ASD patients including oxytocin hormone and other 
hypothalamic-related neuropeptides. There is a paucity 
of reports regarding the volumetric study of VD or its 
components in ASD. Kurth et al. [11] investigated the 
grey matter differences in fifty-two ASD children and 
fifty-two matched control subjects using brain MRI 
with voxel-based morphology analysis; they found sig-
nificantly lower volume of hypothalamic grey matter in 
ASD cases compared with control subjects at the loca-
tion of supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the 
hypothalamus (T = 5.24, P = 0.017 (FEW corr.), Z = 4.91, 
kE = 13). This finding could be in agreement with what 
the current study reported; although our study utilized

a different MRI brain volumetry system which did not 
differentiate between the hypothalamic nuclei and 
other VD components, the authors did not consider 
this point as an obstacle or limitation in our study due 
to universal methodological and technical difficulties 
regarding volumetric brain analysis in ventral dien-
cephalon region. In another study in the same line, 
Wolfe et  al. [12] examined the hypothalamic atrophy 
in ASD directly by measuring the grey matter density 
using voxel-based morphometry analysis on 3D brain 
MRI, and indirectly by measuring the third ventricular 
volume being surrounded by hypothalamic nuclei; they 
reported a decrease in hypothalamic grey matter den-
sity and an increase in third ventricle volume in ASD 
patients compared with typically developing individu-
als. To the best of the author’s knowledge, no report has 
yielded a different finding [11, 12].

Regarding the increased volume of total grey matter in 
ASD in the current study, this could be in partial agree-
ment with Kurth et  al. [11] who investigated the grey 
matter difference in autism spectrum disorder, using 
voxel-based morphometry analysis in 52 affected chil-
dren and adolescents, they observed a slightly higher 
global volume of the whole-brain grey matter in autism; 
however, the differences did not reach significance [11].
Regarding the amygdala and hippocampal volume 
changes in the current study, 96% of subjects showed no 
volume changes; this could be in agreement with Pal-
men et al. [13] who investigated the amygdala and hip-
pocampus volumes in 42 medication-naive children with 
high-functioning autism and Asperger’s syndrome on 
whole-brain MRI scans; they found no significant differ-
ences in amygdala and hippocampus volume for autistic 
and control subjects. In the same line, Barnea-Goraly 
et al. [14] investigated twenty-three children with autism 
with magnetic resonance imaging; they found prelimi-
nary evidence of normalization of amygdala volumes in

ASD; however, they reported a significant increase in 
right hippocampal volume in the autism. On the other 
hand, several studies have yielded contradictory results; 
some of them found an association of ASD with vol-
ume increase in amygdala and/or hippocampus; these 
included Zhu et  al. [15] who examined the amygdala 
volume in 39 preschool children with autism spectrum 
disorder and found significant high total volumes of the 
amygdala in the autism (t = 5.901, P < 0.001). Similarly, 
Gibbard et  al. [16] investigated the amygdala volume 
and amygdala-cortical connections with ASD behav-
iours; they reported greater amygdala volume in ASD 
(F(1,94) = 4.19;  P = 0.04) and altered microstructure of 
connections between the amygdala and the cortex. In 
contrast to all aforementioned studies, some other stud-
ies found significant correlation with volume reduction 
in the aforementioned structures such as Van Dessel 
et al. [17] who examined the amygdala in patients with 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; they suggested a 
functional significance of reduced amygdala volumes in 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. In another study, 
Nicolson et al. [18] studied the hippocampal abnormali-
ties in autism using volumetric magnetic resonance imag-
ing scan at 3 Tesla; they found subtle differences between 
patients and controls in right posterior hippocampus and 
suggested that autism might be associated with regional 
reductions in hippocampal size. These conflicting results 
along with the general lack of logic explanations of such 
volumetric abnormalities could raise more questions 
about the exact pathophysiology of medial temporal and 
global volumetric alterations in ASD population (13–18).
This study had some limitations: The first was the lack 
of control group of normal children of the same age; this 
was due to some logistic difficulties, as all of them would 
be young children and would be exposed to unjustified 
sedation, and the second was the relatively small sample 
size.
Conclusions
Based on the consistent significant volume decrease 
in the ventral diencephalon in patients with childhood 
autism, this study concluded that volumetric MRI analy-
sis could be useful for diagnosis of childhood spectrum 
disorder and could be utilized as a reliable screening 
method in the clinically vague cases. Further study with 
a larger sample size including more age groups is recom-
mended for more validation of the results.
