Abstract  Astrocytes are the largest glial population in the 
mammalian brain. However, we have a minimal understand-
ing of astrocyte development, especially fate specification 
in different regions of the brain. Through lineage tracing of 
the progenitors of the third ventricle (3V) wall via in-utero 
electroporation in the embryonic mouse brain, we show 
the fate specification and migration pattern of astrocytes 
derived from radial glia along the 3V wall. Unexpectedly, 
radial glia located in different regions along the 3V wall of 
the diencephalon produce distinct cell types: radial glia in 
the upper region produce astrocytes and those in the lower 
region produce neurons in the diencephalon. With genetic 
fate mapping analysis, we reveal that the first population 
of astrocytes appears along the zona incerta in the dien-
cephalon. Astrogenesis occurs at an early time point in the 
dorsal region relative to that in the ventral region of the 
developing diencephalon. With transcriptomic analysis of 
the region-specific 3V wall and lateral ventricle (LV) wall, 
we identified cohorts of differentially-expressed genes in the 
dorsal 3V wall compared to the ventral 3V wall and LV wall 
that may regulate astrogenesis in the dorsal diencephalon. 
Together, these results demonstrate that the generation of 
astrocytes shows a spatiotemporal pattern in the developing 
mouse diencephalon.

Introduction
Astrocytes, which are widely distributed throughout the 
mammalian nervous system (CNS), are also its most abun-
dant cell type. The developmental genesis and dysfunction 
of astrocytes are closely associated with neurological disor-
ders such as Rett syndrome and fragile X mental retardation 
[1, 2]. Although numerous lines of evidence have shown that 
astrocytes play pivotal roles in both normal and pathological

conditions [3–5], an understanding of the development of 
the astrocyte lineage is still in its infancy.
The generation of astrocytes in the ventral spinal cord is 
modulated in a regionally restricted manner [6]. For exam-
ple, the cross-repressive interactions between the basic 
helix-loop-helix transcription factors SCL and OLIG2 direct 
astrogenesis in the p2 progenitor domain of the spinal cord 
[7], and the combinatorial expression of homeodomain 
proteins PAX6 and NKX6.1 specifies the region-specific 
subtypes of ventral astrocytes [8]. The radial glia-derived 
astrocytes are allocated to spatial domains in both the spinal 
cord and brain of mice in accordance with their embryonic 
sites of origin in the ventricular zone (VZ) [4]. Consistent 
with this, it has been reported that cortical protoplasmic 
astrocytes are generated in a spatially restricted manner from 
radial glia which also gives rise to developmental columns 
of pyramidal neurons [9].
During CNS development, radial glial cells consist of a 
periventricular cell body and an elongated radial process 
extending from the VZ to the pial surface. These morpho-
logically distinct bipolar cells serve as neural precursor cells 
(NPCs) capable of producing neurons and then astrocytes 
[10]. At perinatal stages, individual radial glia transforms 
into astrocytes in the cortex after neurogenesis is completed 
[11, 12]. To date, the stages in the development of the astro-
cyte lineage, including the specification and migration pro-
cess, have been poorly defined.
In the current study, we explored the fate specification 
and migration of astrocytes derived from region-specific 
radial glia located in the third ventricle (3V) wall during 
the development of the diencephalon. Furthermore, we 
conducted genetic fate mapping analysis of astrocyte pro-
gression using astrocyte-specific hGFAP-CreERT2; Ai14 
transgenic mice. These findings suggest that astrocytes are 
generated with a spatiotemporal pattern in the developing 
diencephalon.
Materials and Methods
Animals
The following transgenic mice were used: hGFAP-CreERT2 
(The Jackson Laboratory, stock 012849) [13] and Ai14 
(Rosa-tdTomato; The Jackson Laboratory, stock 007914) 
[14]. Wild-type C57BL/6J and ICR mice were purchased 
from the Shanghai SLAC Laboratory. To obtain the exact 
embryonic time-point, one male and two female mice were 
placed together in one cage in the evening, and the female’s 
vulva was checked the next morning. E0.5 was logged for 
the first day of pregnancy if a vaginal plug was observed. 
All mice were housed under a 12-h light/dark cycle and had 
ad libitum access to food and water in a controlled animal 
facility. All animals were treated in accordance with proto-
cols approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of 
Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University.
Tamoxifen Treatments
For the induction of CreER-dependent recombination in 
hGFAP-CreERT2;Ai14 transgenic mice, an intraperitoneal 
injection of tamoxifen (T5648, Sigma; dissolved in a 1:9 
mixture of ethanol/sesame oil) at 75 mg/kg body weight was 
administered to pregnant females in a single dose at various 
time points as indicated, and pups were perfusion-fixed at 
P14. Tamoxifen was given by intraperitoneal injection at a 
daily dose of 100 mg/kg body weight to 2-month-old adult 
hGFAP-CreERT2;Ai14 transgenic mice for 4 days, and the 
mice were perfusion-fixed.
Plasmids and In Utero Electroporation
cDNA encoding EYFP was cloned into the vector pCAGGS, 
in which expression is driven by the CAG promoter (modi-
fied chicken β-actin promoter with enhanced sequences from 
CMV). The lentiviral plasmid hGFAP-GFP was generated 
by sub-cloning the synthetic hGFAP promoter [15] into the 
CS-CDF-CG-PRE vector at the EcoRI and AgeI sites. For 
in-utero electroporation (IUE), a simple laparotomy under 
anesthesia was performed on wild-type ICR pregnant female 
mice at 14.5 days of gestation. While the embryos were 
still in the uterus, 1.5 µl of plasmid DNA solution (4 mg/
ml) mixed with Fast Green (2 mg/ml) was directly injected 
into the LV or 3V of the embryonic forebrain using a glass 
micropipette. Five electrical pulses at 35 V with a duration 
of 50 ms/pulse and 950-ms intervals were applied through 
the uterus using an electroporator (ECM 830, BTX). During 
this procedure, the uterus was kept wet with warm saline. 
After the electroporation, the uterus was carefully reposi-
tioned in the abdominal cavity. The cavity was filled with 
warm saline to replenish the abdominal fluids. The abdomi-
nal wall and skin were separately sutured. Pregnant mice 
recovered under a warm lamp and then were returned to 
their home cage. Injected embryos were allowed to develop 
normally and were analyzed 24 h, 36 h, or 72 h after elec-
troporation or at P1, P7, P14, or P21.
Virus Preparation and In Utero Injection
As described previously [16], lentivirus was produced in 
HEK293T cells after transient transfections. Briefly, the 
third-generation replication-deficient lentivirus was gen-
erated by transient transfections of HEK293T cells with 
hGFAP-EGFP lentiviral vector together with the packaging 
plasmids (pMDL, VSVG, and pREV). The virus-containing

culture supernatants were collected and concentrated by 
centrifugation. Viral titers were estimated by quantifying 
GFP-expressing cells of virus-transduced U251 glioma cells 
at 72 h after viral infection. Similar to the IUE method, a 
simple laparotomy under anesthesia was performed on wild-
type ICR pregnant female mice at 14.5 days of gestation. 
While the embryos were still in the uterus, 1.5 μL of lenti-
virus (0.5–1 × ­
109 plaque-forming units/mL) was manually 
injected into the 3V of the embryonic forebrain using a glass 
micropipette.
Immunohistochemistry and Imaging
Embryonic brains were extracted at the indicated ages and 
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Postnatal brains were 
extracted and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde after transcar-
dial perfusion. Brains were further post-fixed overnight and 
then cryoprotected with 30% sucrose in PBS at 4°C. Coro-
nal sections were cut at 16 µm on a Cryostat (Leica) and 
mounted onto Superfrost-plus microscope slides (Fisher). 
For immunostaining, sections were washed with PBS and 
blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. After 
overnight incubation with primary antibodies diluted in the 
blocking solution with gentle agitation at 4°C, sections were 
washed and incubated for 2 h with corresponding second-
ary species-specific antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 
488, 555, or 647 (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Nuclei were 
counterstained with Hoechst 33342. The following primary 
antibodies were used: GFP (chicken, 1:500; AVES), GFAP 
(mouse, 1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich), Aldh1L1 (mouse, 1:500; 
Millipore), PCNA (mouse, 1:400; Santa Cruz), S100β (rab-
bit, 1:1000; Swant), NeuN (mouse, 1:500; Chemicon), 
SOX2 (rabbit, 1:500; Chemicon), OLIG2 (rabbit, 1:500; 
Millipore), NG2 (rabbit, 1:500; BBI Life Sciences), GS 
(mouse,1:500; Millipore), IBA1 (Rabbit, 1:1000; Waco), 
CD31 (rat, 1:1000; BD Biosciences), NFIA (rabbit, 1:500; 
Genetax), AQP4 (mouse, 1:200; Santa Cruz), and Collagen 
IV (rabbit, 1:500; Millipore).
Fluorescent images were acquired on a Leica SP8 or 
Nikon A1 confocal laser microscope system. The confo-
cal images were analyzed by NIH ImageJ software. A Cell 
Counter software plugin in the ImageJ program was used to 
count cells.
RNA Sequencing (RNA‑Seq) and Analysis
Total RNA was isolated from the wall of the 3V or LV of 
E14.5 mouse embryos using the RNAprep pure Micro Kit 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Tiangen Bio-
tech, Beijing, China). The extracted RNA was quantified 
using the Qubit® RNA HS Assay Kit with a Qubit ® 2.0 
Fluorometer (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA). 
The quality of the RNA was analyzed using an Agilent 
2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). 
The RNA-seq libraries for next-generation sequencing and 
paired-end deep sequencing were constructed on an Illumina 
PE150 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA) according to the 
manufacturer’s protocol. Trimmomatic was recruited to low-
quality reads and adaptor trimming with a default setting 
[17] (http://​
www.​
usade​
llab. org/cms/?page=trimmomatic). 
Cleaned reads were mapped to the ensemble mouse refer-
ence genome GRCm38.p6 (http://​
asia.​
ensem​
bl.​

lus/ Info/Index) with Hisat2 [18]. The mapped reads 
were counted to genes using featureCounts (http://​
subre​

sourc​
eforge.​
net/). Principal component analysis (PCA) 
clustering plots, volcano plots, and heat maps were gener-
ated using the R programming language. Targeted gene set 
enrichment analysis (GSEA) was applied following previous 
protocols [19, 20]. A custom geneset that represents positive 
regulation of astrogenesis and astrocyte development was 
generated (Table S5). Genes were pre-ranked through the 
metrics algorithm (log fold change × −log10 (p-value [not 
adjusted p-val)] according to the statistical result of DESeq2. 
Pre-ranked (.rnk) file and custom geneset were used as input 
for GSEA v4.0.3 (https://​

jsp). The number of permutations was set at 1000 and the 
enrichment statistic was set at “weighted”.
Experimental Design and Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean 
(SEM). Statistical analysis was done and graphs were pro-
duced using GraphPad Prism 8.0 software (La Jolla, CA, 
USA). Data from two groups were analyzed with a two-
tailed unpaired Student’s t-test. Data from multiple groups 
were analyzed with one-way ANOVA followed by Turkey’s 
multiple comparison post hoc test. A level of P <0.05 was 
considered statistically significant. For RNA-Seq analysis, 
differential expression analysis was applied using DESeq2 
(https://​

(log2FC) 
>1. For GSEA analysis, FDR q-val <0.25 and |NES| >1 
were considered as significant enrichment.

entire diencephalon 36 h post-IUE (Figs. 1C and S1B). 72 
h post-IUE, we observed some ­
EYFP+ radial glia that had 
migrated out of the VZ/subventricular zone (SVZ) of the 3V 
and showed astrocytic morphology in the parenchyma of the 
dorsal diencephalon (Figs. 1D and S1C).
The peak of neurogenesis occurs at E14.5 in rodent neo-
cortex [23]. After the NPCs were labeled with CAG-EYFP 
plasmid by electroporation in the wall of the 3V versus the 
lateral ventricle (LV), their fate specification was lineage-
traced after birth. Consistently, NPCs located within the dor-
sal ventricular wall of the LV at E14.5 differentiated into 
pyramidal-like neurons that migrated to the superficial layer 
of the cerebral cortex by P7 (Fig. S2A). In sharp contrast, 
EYFP-labeled radial glia at E14.5 produced two distinct cell 
populations in the diencephalon at P7, astrocyte-like cells 
on the dorsal side and neuron-like cells on the ventral side 
(Fig. S2B).
The fate of the progeny of radial glia that underwent 
IUE at E14.5 was also examined at P21, ~4 weeks post-
electroporation (Fig. 1E). Accordingly, we also observed 
two populations - astrocyte-like cells in the thalamus and 
neuronal-like cells in the hypothalamus - in the diencephalon 
at P21 (Fig. 1F). By immunostaining, we further confirmed 
that 100% of ­
EYFP+ cells in the cerebral cortex were posi-
tive for NeuN, a marker for mature neurons, at P21 (Fig. 1G 
and H). In contrast, we found that 98% of ­
EYFP+ cells in the 
thalamus were glutamine synthetase-positive (GS)+ astro-
cytes, and 95% of ­
EYFP+ cells in the hypothalamus were 
­
NeuN+ neurons at P21 (Fig. 1H–J).
Tracing Astrocyte Migration in the Developing 
Diencephalon
To understand the migration of astrocytes in the developing 
diencephalon, we next injected the enhanced green fluores-
cent protein (EGFP) reporter plasmid under the control of 
the human GFAP promoter (hGFAP-EGFP) and electropo-
rated it into the progenitors lining the 3V wall of E14.5 
mouse embryos. Similar to the results from the CAG-EYFP 
plasmid experiments, the hGFAP-EGFP−labeled cells in the 
3V wall also showed radial glial morphology 24 h post-IUE 
(Fig. S3A). The radial migration of astrocyte progenitors 
with various morphologies in the dorsal diencephalon was 
observed when sections were examined at E17.5 (Figs 2A 
and S3B). The cell bodies of astrocyte progenitors were flat 
or round with multiple processes (Fig. 2D and E). Notably, 
some migrating astrocyte progenitors had quite long leading 
processes with spine-like protrusions (Fig. 2F). The radial 
migration pattern of astrocytes was found in the dorsal dien-
cephalon when examined at P1 (Fig. 2G). In addition, the 
EGFP-expressing cells that migrated to the parenchyma 
of the diencephalon were stained with BLBP, an astrocyte 
marker [24, 25], at both E17.5 and P1 (Fig. 2H–O, arrows).
Fate Specification of Migrating Astrocyte Progenitors 
in the Developing Diencephalon
To further confirm the identity of the migrating progeni-
tors labeled by hGFAP-EGFP, we stained the electroporated 
brains with an antibody for Aldh1L1, a broad astrocyte 
marker [26, 27]. The hGFAP-EGFP−labeled cells exhib-
ited extensive colocalization with the staining of Aldh1L1 
in the diencephalon at E17.5 (Fig. 3A–D). Compared with 
numerous ­
Aldh1L1+ astrocyte progenitors in the diencepha-
lon, very few cells were positive for Aldh1L1 in the cortex 
(Fig. 3E–H). These cortical ­
Aldh1L1+ cells were mainly 
distributed in the ventricular wall of the LV and showed 
radial glial morphology (Fig. 3F).
We next stained electroporated brain sections with the 
antibody against nuclear factor I A (NFIA), a transcription 
factor known to regulate gliogenesis in the embryonic spinal 
cord [28] and developing cortex [29]. The hGFAP-EGFP-
expressing cells were largely co-labelled with NFIA in the 
3V wall at E17.5 (Fig. 3I–L). In contrast, weak expres-
sion of NIFA was detected in the wall of the LV but was 
highly expressed in the deep cortical layers and subplate 
(Fig.  3M–P). Furthermore, the EGFP-expressing cells 
were not stained positive for markers of NG2 glia (NG2, 
Fig. 3Q–T) or oligodendrocytes (OLIG2, Fig. 3U–X).
Tracing Astrocyte Proliferation and Maturation 
in the Developing Diencephalon
To characterize the proliferation profile of astrocytes in the 
early developing diencephalon, we stained brain sections at 
E17.5 and P1 for PCNA, a specific marker for proliferating 
cells, after electroporation at E14.5. As shown in Fig. 4A–D 
(arrows), 9% and 19% of ­
EGFP+ cells were dividing cells 
­
(EGFP+PCNA+) at E17.5 and P1 (Fig. 4G), respectively. 
These data suggest that early migrating astrocytes undergo 
proliferation in the developing diencephalon.
The progeny of ­
EGFP+ cells labeled in the 3V wall by 
IUE were examined at P21. All the EGFP-expressing cells in 
the dorsal part of the diencephalon showed astrocyte features

with bushy morphology (Fig. 4H and H’). In contrast, the 
­
EGFP+ cells in the ventral diencephalon were confined to 
the wall of the 3V and had radial glial (tanycyte-like) mor-
phology (Fig. 4H and H’’). These ­
EGFP+ cells projected 
their long extended basal processes into the parenchyma, 
and some processes appeared to end at the pial surface of 
the hypothalamus (Fig. 4H’’).
Astrocytic endfeet is crucial for the structure of the blood-
brain barrier and the regulation of cerebral blood flow [30, 
31]. Endfeet of cortical astrocytes almost fully cover the 
blood vessels by P20 [25]. Staining with an antibody against 
W. Hong et al.: Temporal-spatial Generation of Astrocytes
1 3
CD31, a marker for endothelial cells [32], indicated that 61% 
and 95% of the ­
EGFP+ astrocytes formed endfeet structures 
with blood vessels in the dorsal diencephalon at P7 and 
P14, respectively (Fig. 4J–L). By contrast, endfeet struc-
tures with blood vessels in ­
EGFP+ astrocytes were rarely 
observed at P1 (Fig. 4K and L). In addition, staining with 
an antibody against AQP4, which is restrictively expressed 
on the perivascular endfeet in astrocytes [33], displayed co-
localization with ­
EGFP+ astrocytes and collagen ­
IV+ blood 
vessels (Fig. 4M–P, arrows). These results indicate the tem-
poral maturation of astrocytes in the postnatal diencephalon.
Astrocyte Specification Traced Through a Lentivirus 
in the Developing Diencephalon
We next traced astrocyte specification by injecting the 
hGFAP-EGFP lentivirus into the 3V of E14.5 mouse 
embryos, since the IUE approach might be limited in its abil-
ity to detect the region-specific progenitors due to potentially 
insufficient levels of the episomal-based reporter plasmid. 
We found that the virus-infected ­
EGFP+ cells at P21 were 
mainly distributed in the dorsal diencephalon with astrocytic 
morphology (Fig. 5A, A’ and A’’), similar to IUE-labeled 
cells in the diencephalon. In addition, the EGFP-expressing 
cells were ­
GS+ and were not co-localized with the stain-
ing of OLIG2, a marker for the oligodendrocyte lineage 
(Fig. 5B–G).
Astrocyte Lineage Development in the Diencephalon 
Versus the Telencephalon
The hGFAP promoter drives gene expression localized in 
the VZ of the developing embryonic telencephalon [34]. 
Crossing the inducible astrocyte-specific line hGFAP-Cre-
ERT2 with Ai14 transgenic mice allowed robust expression 
of the red fluorescent protein tdTomato (tdT) after inducible 
astrocyte-specific Cre-mediated recombination [25]. We first 
checked the specificity of tamoxifen-induced ­
tdT+ cells in 
the adult brain regions of hGFAP-CreERT2;Ai14 transgenic 
mice. All ­
tdT+ cells were S100β+ astrocytes in the cortex 
(Fig. S4A–D), thalamus (Fig. S4E–H), and hypothalamus 
(Fig. S4I–H). Furthermore, after 48 h of tamoxifen admin-
istration that began at E14.5, we found a few radial glia-
like cells in the dorsal 3V wall (Fig. S5A and a1), whereas 
multiple ­
tdT+ cells were present in the dorsal telencephalon 
(Fig. S5A and a2).
To determine the underlying pattern of temporal-spatial 
generation of astrocytes in the diencephalon versus the tel-
encephalon, we performed a genetic fate mapping analysis

tamoxifen to timed-pregnant hGFAP-CreERT2;Ai14 trans-
genic mice at E14.5, E16.5, and E18.5. In the P14 hGFAP-
CreERT2;Ai14 transgenic mice treated with tamoxifen at 
E14.5, we found that all ­
tdT+ cells displayed astrocytic mor-
phology in the diencephalon (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, these 
astrocyte-like cells were mostly distributed along the zona 
incerta in the dorsal region above the 3V (Fig. 6A and a1). In 
contrast, only a few scattered ­
tdT+ astrocyte-like cells were 
observed in the ventral region of the diencephalon (Fig. 6A 
and a2). In the cerebral cortex, the ­
tdT+ cells that were 
induced at E14.5 exhibited both pyramidal neuron-like and 
protoplasmic astrocyte-like cells (Fig. 6A, a3, and a4). Some 
­
tdT+ dividing protoplasmic astrocytes were found in cortical 
layers II/III (Fig. 6A and a5). In the hippocampal forma-
tion, most of the ­
tdT+ cells displayed the morphology of 
pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1/CA3 region or 
of granular neurons localized in the dentate gyrus (Fig. 6A 
and a6). Compared with the ­
tdT+ cells induced at E14.5 
in the diencephalon, there was a dramatic increase in ­
tdT+ 
astrocyte-like cells, particularly in the dorsal region above 
the 3V, that was induced by tamoxifen at E16.5 (Fig. 6B and 
b1). In addition to scattered astrocytes in the ventral region 
of the diencephalon, we also observed ­
tdT+ tanycytes lin-
ing the 3V wall with long processes (Fig. 6B and b2). The 
­
tdT+ cells induced at E18.5 showed a large population of 
astrocyte-like cells distributed across the entire forebrain 
(Fig. 6C). In the dentate gyrus, most of the ­
tdT+ cells that 
were induced at E14.5, E16.5, or E18.5 showed a granular 
neuron morphology (Fig. 6a6, b4, and c4), suggesting that 
cells with an active hGFAP promoter continue to generate 
neurons during the development of the dentate gyrus.

Temporal‑spatial Generation of Astrocytes 
in the Developing Diencephalon
The cellular fates of ­
tdT+ cells induced at timed develop-
mental stages were assessed at P14. By immunostaining 
for cell type-specific markers, we found no cells in the 
diencephalon were ­
NeuN+ or ­
Olig2+ (Fig. 7A and B). In 
contrast, all ­
tdT+ cells induced at E14.5, E16.5, or E18.5 
were positive for S100β (Fig. 7B, F, and I). Although all 
­
tdT+ cells in the diencephalon were astrocytes, 80% of ­
tdT+ 
cells induced at E14.5 were ­
NeuN+ and only 20% of ­
tdT+ 
cells were ­
GS+ astrocytes in the cortex (Fig. 7C, D, and M).

Notably, the ratio of ­
tdT+ cells displaying co-localization 
with GS staining in the cerebral cortex was increased to 
82.0% with induction at E16.5 and to 93% with induction 
at E18.5 (Fig. 7H, L, N, and O). Interestingly, in addition to 
the 6% of ­
tdT+ cells that were ­
NeuN+ in the cortex of mice 
induced at E18.5, we also found that 2% of ­
tdT+ cells were

astrogenesis occurs at an early time point in the dorsal 
region relative to that in the ventral region of the develop-
ing diencephalon.

and telencephalon, we dissected the dorsal 3V wall (3V-d), 
the ventral 3V wall (3V-v), and the dorsal LV wall (LV-
d) from E14.5 mouse brains and applied RNA-seq analysis 
(Fig. 8A). PCA analysis showed that the three biological 
replicates of each dissection group were clustered together, 
indicating reproducible sample dissections and high quality 
of RNA-seq data (Fig. 8B). Compared with the transcripts 
in the 3V-v group, 452 genes were up-regulated (Table S1) 
and 808 genes were down-regulated (Table S2) in the 3V-d 
group (Fig. 8C). Comparing the genes in the LV-d group, we 
found 3365 genes were up-regulated (Table S3) and 3070 
genes were down-regulated (Table S4) in the 3V-d group 
(Fig. 8D). The up-regulated genes such as Gbx2, Wif1, 
Slc17a6, and Id3 (Fig. 8E and F), may be involved in the 
induction of astrogenesis in the dorsal diencephalon. On the 
other hand, the down-regulated genes in the 3V-d group,

such as Sox3, Nkx2-3, AIcam, and Wnt7a (Fig. 8E and F), 
may promote neurogenesis in the ventral diencephalon and 
the cortex. We also applied GSEA analysis of the differ-
entially expressed genes with a geneset representing posi-
tive regulation of astrogenesis and astrocyte development 
(Table S5). Remarkably, we found the up-regulated genes 
in the 3V-d group were highly concordant with the geneset 
for astrogenesis (Fig. 8G and H).
Discussion
Despite the impressive progress in understanding astrocyte 
differentiation from NPCs [35, 36], the spatiotemporal speci-
fication and lineage progression of astrocytes remain largely 
unexplored. By examining the production and expansion of 
astrocytes, especially in the developing mouse diencephalon, 
our results reveal new insights into the spatiotemporal regu-
lation of astrocyte development in this brain region.
Radial glia translocate from the lateral VZ and become 
immature astrocytes in the cortex during the late embryonic 
or early postnatal phase [11, 37]. However, how the radial 
glia located within the 3V wall give rise to astrocytes in the 
diencephalon is not well characterized. With IUE labeling of 
the progenitors lining the 3V wall, we found that the radial 
glial cells expressing the EYFP reporter migrate out of the 
VZ/SVZ and later generate astrocytes in the parenchyma of 
the dorsal diencephalon. Interestingly, we found two dis-
tinct fates of EYFP-labeled radial glial cells based on their 
locations: radial glial cells from the dorsal VZ give rise to 
astrocytes in the thalamus, whereas those from the ventral 
VZ produce neurons in the hypothalamus. Our RNA-seq 
analysis revealed a cohort of genes that are differentially 
expressed in the dorsal 3V wall when compared to the ven-
tral 3V wall or the dorsal LV wall. Future experiments are 
warranted to determine the key transcription factors or sign-
aling pathways that govern the spatiotemporal behavior of 
radial glia.
Consistent with the CAG-EYFP labeling results of the 
radial glia based on IUE, progenitors in the 3V wall elec-
troporated with the hGFAP-EGFP plasmid or transduced 
with the hGFAP-EGFP lentivirus differentiate into astrocytes 
in the dorsal diencephalon. We observed the varied morpho-
logical shapes of the astrocyte progenitors in the process of 
radial migration. These radially migrating cells in the dor-
sal diencephalon express markers for astrocytes (BLBP and 
Aldh1L1) but not oligodendrocytes or NG2 glia. Although 
evidence has shown that astrocytes and oligodendrocytes 
share a common lineage in the developing CNS [35, 38], 
our results reveal that these EYFP- or EGFP-labeled radial 
glial cells do not give rise to oligodendrocytes in the dien-
cephalon. In addition, these IUE-labeled astrocytes undergo 
proliferation as early as E17.5. Unlike numerous astrocytic 
progeny derived from radial glia in the dorsal domain of the 
third VZ, the ­
EGFP+ radial glial−like cells remain along 
the ventral portion of the 3V wall with long extended pro-
cesses at P21. In the postnatal hypothalamus, ­
GFAP+ alpha 
tanycytes proliferate in response to intracerebral infusion of 
EGF and FGF and have the potential for neurogenesis [39, 
40]. Our results further indicate that these EGFP-positive 
tanycyte-like cells labeled at E14.5 by IUE remain largely 
quiescent 3 weeks after birth, similar to the adult progenitor 
B1 cells within the LV walls [41].
Expression of transgenes driven by the hGFAP promoter 
is detectable specifically in radial glia in the cortical VZ as 
early as E14.5 [42]. By using the StarTrack method, which 
is based on the combinatorial expression of six fluorescent 
reporter proteins under the control of the hGFAP promoter, 
researchers have analyzed the astrocyte lineage and revealed 
highly specific clonal distribution patterns in the rodent cor-
tex [43, 44]. Our genetic fate mapping analysis of hGFAP-
CreERT2;Ai14 transgenic mice by tamoxifen treatment at 
timed embryonic stages demonstrates the temporal-spatial 
generation of astrocytes in the developing diencephalon as 
well as the telencephalon. In agreement with the sequential 
neuron-glia differentiation of neural precursor cells in the 
cortex [23], the progeny of cortical astrocytes is dramati-
cally increased with tamoxifen induction at time points later 
than E14.5. The lineage tracing at E14.5−P14 of hGFAP-
CreERT2;Ai14 transgenic mice identified the first population 
of astrocytes that are distributed along the zona incerta in 
the diencephalon. It will be interesting to investigate which 
signals direct the progression of these astrocytes.
Compared with varied fate specifications of the induced 
­
tdT+ cells in the telencephalon, all ­
tdT+ cells induced at 
each embryonic time point in the diencephalon give rise to 
S100β+ astrocytes. The temporal difference in the emergence 
of astrocytes between the telencephalon and diencephalon 
may be due to the relatively earlier gliogenesis in the dien-
cephalon [45]. Unexpectedly, we found that 2% of ­
tdT+ cells 
induced at E18.5 are ­
IBA1+ microglia in the P14 cortex. 
To our knowledge, this result is the first showing that the 
hGFAP promoter can drive reporter expression in microglia 
in the developing cerebral cortex. This may have resulted 
from transient hGFAP promoter activity in very few corti-
cal microglia during the late embryonic stage. Furthermore, 
microglia have recently been shown to phagocytose exces-
sively produced astrocytes in the retina [46, 47], raising the 
possibility that ­
IBA+ microglia may have engulfed ­
tdT+ 
astrocytes during cortical development.
A study by in vivo clonal analysis demonstrated that 
astrogenesis in the cerebellum follows a well-defined spa-
tiotemporal pattern and an orderly developmental program 
[48]. Further lineage tracing studies will be important to

determine the timing of astrogenesis and regional differences 
of the astrocytic lineage in many other brain regions such as 
the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, striatum, and brain stem.
