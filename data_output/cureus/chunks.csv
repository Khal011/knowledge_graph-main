Pritz Department of Neurological Surgery, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Ind. , USA noted further parcellation of the synencephalon into an an- terior and posterior component, whereas others have not. Notwithstanding differe nces as to whether the synencepha- lon is a single unit or not, these detailed analyses in reptiles (Alligator) , birds (chick), and mammals (humans), suggest that the initial pattern of early diencephalon development in amniotes is similar. Copyright  2007 S. Karger AG, Basel Introduction A number of approaches have been used to unravel the organization and evolution of the forebrain in vertebrates Nieuwenhuys, 1998b. Varying degrees of success have been achieved through an analysis of neuronal cell types and aggregates and their respective properties in a wide variety of adult animals Nieuwenhuys, 1998b; Striedter, 2005 usually selecting representative species in a given class. An alternative approach has been to analyze devel- opment, with the hope that certain features might be un- covered which would have remained obscure had only adult animals been examined Puelles, 1995.|data_input\cureus\Dien.DevelopBBE2008-pages.txt|af887b3105674984bc39bc6da28f6c7f
