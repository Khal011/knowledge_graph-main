Introduction
 
A number of approaches have been used to unravel the 
organization and evolution of the forebrain in vertebrates 
[Nieuwenhuys, 1998b]. Varying degrees of success have 
been achieved through an analysis of neuronal cell types 
and aggregates and their respective properties in a wide 
variety of adult animals [Nieuwenhuys, 1998b; Striedter, 
2005] usually selecting representative species in a given 
class. An alternative approach has been to analyze devel-
opment, with the hope that certain features might be un-
covered which would have remained obscure had only 
adult animals been examined [Puelles, 1995].
 
In analyzing the forebrain, the diencephalon was cho-
sen rather than the telencephalon because its properties 
in nearly every aspect are seemingly less complex than 
that of the telencephalon [Sherman and Guillery, 2006]. 
It is believed that the diencephalon shares common char-
acters in all vertebrates during early development and 
changes occur later in time which are specific for that 
group or species [Bergquist, 1952; Bergquist and Källén, 
1954; Rubenstein et al., 1994]. However, some researchers

Abstract
 
Diencephalon development was investigated in a reptilian 
embryo,  
Alligator mississipiensis 
, beginning at a single com-
partment stage and continuing until internal subdivisions 
were present within major units. A variety of morphological 
techniques were used: immunocytochemistry, histochemis-
try, and cresyl violet staining. The diencephalon begins as a 
single unit. In the transverse domain, the diencephalon sub-
sequently divides into two: the parencephalon and the syn-
encephalon. The parencephalon then splits into the paren-
cephalon anterior and parencephalon posterior. Still later, 
the synencephalon undergoes parcellation into the synen-
cephalon anterior and synencephalon posterior. Subse-
quently, internal subdivisions occur in each of these four 
compartments. When the diencephalon has become subdi-
vided into two compartments and continuing until internal 
subdivisions are present in each unit, a longitudinal border 
separating a dorsal, presumed alar plate, from a ventral, pre-
sumed basal plate, was seen. No clear cut subunits were reli-
ably identified in the telencephalon or secondary prosen-
cephalon during this period of early development in  
Alligator. 
 
Early diencephalon development in birds (chick) and mam-
mals (humans) follows a similar pattern. Specifically, a single 
diencephalic compartment divides into two zones: the par-
encephalon and synencephalon. Subsequently, the paren-
cephalon becomes subdivided into an anterior and poste-
rior unit. Some studies, including the present one, have

have questioned whether such a phylotypic stage exists 
for body plans in vertebrates [Richardson et al., 1997]. It 
remains to be seen whether or not such a phylotypic stage 
is present for developing vertebrate brains.
 
Most developmental studies have focused on just a few 
species [Richardson et al., 1997] concentrating on mouse 
as a representative mammal and chick as an example for 
birds. However, because mammals and birds diverged 
early in phylogeny [Kumar and Hedges, 1998; Benton, 
1999], using representatives solely from these two classes 
would not distinguish between similarities of the features 
in question based on inheritance from a common ances-
tor versus independent evolution of these traits [Pritz, 
2005].
 
Crocodilians are the reptilian group most closely re-
lated to birds [Whetstone and Martin, 1979; Hedges, 
1994]. As a representative of this order, the American al-
ligator,  
Alligator mississipiensis 
, was selected because it is 
relatively available and its developmental stages have 
been well characterized [Ferguson, 1985].
 
This report details early diencephalon development in 
 
Alligator 
 before overt compartmentalization begins and 
continues until the major histogenetic zones have be-
come internally subdivided. Morphological techniques 
that proved successful in analyzing early hindbrain de-
velopment in  
Alligator 
 [Pritz, 1999] were applied to the 
forebrain. These observations form the basis of this re-
port.
 
Two questions were addressed. First, what morpho-
logic features identify divisions of the diencephalon at 
early stages of development in  
Alligator 
? Second, how do 
these observations in  
Alligator 
 compare with early dien-
cephalon development in other vertebrates? Only by doc-
umenting that the organization of the  
Alligator 
 dienceph-
alon early in development is similar to that found in birds, 
mammals, and other vertebrates can later divergences in 
morphology be of potential biological significance. Spe-
cifically, it was hypothesized that early diencephalon de-
velopment in  
Alligator 
 would follow the pattern described 
for birds [Vaage, 1969; Puelles et al., 1987; Larsen et
al., 2001 – chick] and mammals [Müller and O’Rahilly, 
1997 – humans]. If so, changes occurring later in ontog-
eny could be identified as the key events that produced 
the adult diencephalon in  
Alligator 
 and perhaps other 
reptiles. These developmental events in  
Alligator 
 could 
then be compared with similar ontogenetic changes in 
diencephalon development in birds and mammals. 
Armed with these stage specific morphologic data, the 
molecular events responsible for these findings could be 
investigated.
 
The present analysis did not attempt to determine 
whether the observed diencephalic subdivisions repre-
sented and satisfied the developmentally significant cri-
teria enumerated by others [Keynes and Lumsden, 1990; 
Lumsden, 1990]. Similarly, these experiments did not in-
vestigate gene or transcription factor expression because 
it was first necessary to identify the individual units and 
their appearance during ontogeny before investigating 
other properties. Furthermore, unlike the hindbrain 
where rhombomeres can readily be seen even in un-
stained whole mount preparations [Pritz, 1999], identifi-
cation of transversal diencephalic subdivisions proved 
much more elusive.
 
Materials and Methods
 
Procedures and protocols listed below were reviewed and ap-
proved by the Indiana University School of Medicine animal care 
committee. These details conform to the National Institute of 
Health guidelines.
 
Animals
 
Alligator 
 eggs were obtained from the Rockefeller Wildlife 
Refuge in Grand Chenier, Louisiana. The location of the embryo 
was marked and the egg positioned with the embryo on top. Eggs 
were placed in a 2: 
  1 mixture of vermiculite and water in an incu-
bator at a temperature of 30 
  ° 
  C.
 
Embryos were sacrificed between stages 2 and 16 [Ferguson, 
1985]. Viable embryos were harvested by making an opening in 
the eggshell using fine scissors under magnification from an op-
erating microscope. A variety of fixatives were used for the vari-
ous morphological stains. However, best results for histochemical 
and immunocytochemical experiments were obtained with 100% 
methanol as the fixative in which embryos could be stored for 
many months at –70 
  ° 
  C. Embryos were first staged [Ferguson, 
1985] and then dissected free from surrounding tissues using a 
fine tungsten needle, microscissors, and jeweler’s forceps. Except 
at the earliest stages, brains were divided at the isthmus and the 
forebrain and midbrain were processed as a single unit.
 
In brains stored at –70 
  ° 
  C, best results for histochemistry and 
immunocytochemistry were achieved by gradual tissue re-warm-
ing: –20 
  ° 
  C (30–60 min); 4 
  ° 
  C (30–60 min); and then room tem-
perature ( 
6 
30 min) prior to embedding. Brains stained for cresyl 
violet were placed in a variety of fixatives: 10% formalin; 4% para-
formaldehyde; 4% glutaraldehyde; or Bouin’s solution (0.9% pic-
ric acid, 9% formaldehyde).
 
Tissue Processing
 
Embedding and sectioning of tissue processed for peanut ag-
glutinin histochemistry or immunocytochemistry was identical 
to the methods described previously [Pritz, 1999]. These tech-
niques are summarized briefly.
 
Brains were embedded in gelatin or albumin-gelatin. Blocks 
that were processed for histochemistry or immunocytochemistry 
were placed overnight in 30% sucrose in sodium phosphate buffer 
(PBS; 0.1  
M 
 at pH 7.2). At least 4h before sectioning, blocks were

placed in a solution of 2–4% formalin-30% sucrose-PBS. For cre-
syl violet staining, blocks were placed in 30% sucrose-10% forma-
lin or 30% sucrose-4% glutaraldehyde solution overnight before 
sectioning. Frozen sections were cut sagittally or horizontally at 
25–40  
! 
m on a sliding microtome and collected in PBS. Sagit-
tally sectioned brains were cut parallel to the rostrocaudal axis 
( 
fig. 1 
A) and brains cut horizontally were embedded with the dor-
sal brain surface as a base and then sectioned parallel to the plane 
illustrated in  
figure 1 
B. In a few cases, brains were sectioned 
transversely. With the exception of identification of the zona li-
mitans interparencephalica, this plane of section was not useful 
at the stages of development examined in this study.
 
Methodology for peanut agglutinin histochemistry was iden-
tical to that described previously [Pritz, 1999]. Briefly, free float-
ing sections were washed in three changes of PBS and then incu-
bated in horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-peanut lectin (50  
! 
g/ml) 
for 12–24 h. Tissue was then washed in three changes of PBS be-
fore incubation in a diaminobenzidine (DAB) solution consisting 
of 100 mg DAB in 10 ml of distilled water plus l ml of Triton X-100 
plus 20 ml of 0.2  
M 
 cacodylic buffer (pH 5.6) plus 6  
! 
l of 30% hy-
drogen peroxide for 30 s. Sections were then transferred to a solu-
tion of 70% alcohol for 1 min and then stored in PBS at 4 
  ° 
  C until 
they were mounted out of distilled water onto chrome-alum coat-
ed slides.
 
Methods for immunocytochemical experiments were identi-
cal to procedures described in an earlier report [Pritz, 1999]. In 
short, free floating sections were washed in three changes of PBS 
and then incubated in the primary antibody in PBS containing 
2% normal goat serum for 24 h followed by three changes in PBS 
and then incubated with the secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse 
IgG, Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA for primary antibodies raised 
in mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG, Vector Labs, for primary anti-
bodies raised in rabbit) at a concentration of 1: 
  100 for 1 h. After 
three changes in PBS, sections were incubated in a peroxidase-
antiperoxidase (PAP) complex appropriate for the primary anti-
body (mouse PAP or rabbit PAP; Chemicon, Temecula, CA) in 
PBS containing 2% normal goat serum at a concentration of 1: 
  300 
for 1 h. Sections were then washed in three changes of PBS before 
being reacted for 30 s in a DAB solution (see above) after which 
the reaction was stopped by transfer to a solution of 70% alcohol 
for 1 min before placement in PBS at 4 
  ° 
  C until mounting. Mount-
ed sections processed for either histochemistry or immunochem-
istry were dehydrated through a series of graded alcohols, cleared 
in xylene, and then coverslipped.
 
Immunoreactivity was observed with the following antibod-
ies: monoclonal mouse anti-acetylated tubulin (1: 
  500; Sigma, St. 
Louis, Mo., USA); mouse monoclonal anti-vimentin (1: 
  50 or
1: 
  100; Sigma); mouse monoclonal anti-acetylcholinesterase (1: 
  50 
or 1: 
  100; Chemicon); and polyclonal rabbit anti-calretinin (1: 
  500 
or 1: 
  1250; Chemicon). The following antibodies were unsuccess-
ful in labeling forebrain compartments: monoclonal mouse anti-
neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) (Sigma); monoclonal 
mouse anti-glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP; Boehringer 
Mannheim, Indianapolis, Ind., USA); and monoclonal mouse 
anti-growth-associated protein 43 (GAP 43; Sigma).
 
Controls for nonspecific staining were the following. One was 
substitution of normal rabbit or mouse serum for the primary 
antibody at a concentration equal to or greater than that of the 
primary antibody. A second was omission of the primary anti-
body from the reaction. Forebrain compartments were not visual-
ized in this control tissue examined at these stages. Third, varia-
tion in antibody concentration produced more intense staining at 
higher, primary antibody concentrations.
 
Histological Analysis
 
Processed forebrain tissue was viewed under bright field illu-
mination. Selected sections were drawn using a camera lucida 
drawing tube attached to a Leitz microscope or photographed us-
ing an Olympus microscope and a digital camera. Images were 
acquired in color, converted to black and white photos, and then 
imported into Adobe Photoshop 7.0 where the images were 
grouped in panels and labels were applied.
 
Results
 
The observations described below investigated fore-
brain subdivisions along two axes: rostrocaudal and dor-
soventral. The former identified transverse diencephalic 
segments whereas the latter defined the presumed alar 
and basal plate of each respective division. This analysis 
began at the single segment stage and continued until in-
ternal subdivisions within a given primary compartment 
were observed. Morphological distinction between pre-
sumed alar and basal plate proved more difficult than the 
identification of transverse segments or their boundaries. 
Clear and reproducible divisions of the telencephalon or 
secondary prosencephalon were not observed. The ros-
tral-most forebrain at stages after initial diencephalic 
compartmentalization was referred to as the secondary 
prosencephalon. The hypothalamus was included as part 
of the secondary prosencephalon and not as part of the 
diencephalon proper. Although some embryos were sec-
tioned transversely during these stages of diencephalon 
development, observations in the sagittal or horizontal 
plane proved most useful. For naming of diencephalic 
subdivisions, the classical terms parencephalon and syn-
encephalon were used [Rendahl, 1924; Puelles et al., 1987] 
and subsequently divided into anterior and posterior 
zones. The border separating the parencephalon anterior 
from the parencephalon posterior was termed the zona 
limitans interparencephalica following the nomencla-
ture of others [Rendahl, 1924; Puelles et al., 1987].
 
A number of antibodies and histochemical markers 
were screened for their usefulness in identifying dience-
phalic subdivisions. Selection of these markers was guid-
ed by the observations of others (see below) and by the 
success of these stains in analyzing early hindbrain de-
velopment in  
Alligator 
 [Pritz, 1999]. For example, an 
anti-neural cell adhesion molecule which labeled dience-
phalic borders in chick [Figdor and Stern, 1993; Larsen 
et al., 2001] was unsuccessful in marking boundaries in

the present analysis. Similarly, peanut agglutinin histo-
chemical preparations, which distinguish odd from even 
segments in chick [Figdor and Stern, 1993], stained the 
diencephalon in  
Alligator 
 differently (see below). Fur-
thermore, features that distinguished presumptive alar 
from basal plate were less distinct than transverse dien-
cephalic zones or their respective borders. Frequently, 
this separation was highlighted by a staining pattern as 
opposed to a distinct line dividing the diencephalon lon-
gitudinally. Similarly, the pattern of longitudinal fibers 
stained by the antibody to acetylated tubulin early in 
compartmentalization gave the appearance of a dorso-
ventral boundary although the fibers themselves might 
not have represented this border. Nevertheless, a com-
bination of histochemical and immunocytochemical 
markers coupled with the Nissl stained appearance in 
tissue which was examined both sagittally and horizon-
tally over a number of developmental stages was felt to 
give a reliable and accurate assessment of early dienceph-
alon development.
 
Single Segment Stage
 
At stage 2 [Ferguson, 1985], the telencephalon and di-
encephalon are unsegmented. The course and distribu-
tion of fibers visualized by acetylated tubulin immuno-
reactivity distinguished the diencephalon from the telen-
cephalon rostrally and the mesencephalon caudally 
( 
fig. 2 
A). Clear borders between these three divisions 
were not nearly as distinct in Nissl stained material 
( 
fig. 2 
B). Regardless of the stain used, correlation of ex-
ternal shape and internal division was present ( 
fig. 2 
). No 
longitudinal boundary separating presumed alar from 
basal plate was seen.
 
Two Segment Stage
 
Beginning at stage 3 and continuing through stage 4 
[Ferguson, 1985], the diencephalon becomes subdivided 
into an anterior parencephalon and a posterior synen-
cephalon. In fiber stained material using an antibody to 
acetylated tubulin, two wedge shaped areas separated by 
a fiber free zone were seen. Fiber sparse regions located 
posteriorly and anteriorly suggested borders with the 
mesencephalon and secondary prosencephalon respec-
tively ( 
fig. 3 
A). A similar appearance of the two dience-
phalic segments was seen in Nissl stained material 
( 
fig. 3 
B). In tissue processed for calretinin immunocyto-
chemistry, a distinct border between the mesencephalon 
and synencephalon was observed. No clear boundary 
separating the parencephalon from the secondary pros-
encephalon was seen. Most of the parencephalon was cal-
retinin immunoreactive ( 
fig. 3 
C). For the first time dur-
ing development, a dorsoventral boundary was observed. 
It was occupied by fibers ( 
fig. 3 
A, B) and was marked by 
calretinin immunoreactivity. Using this latter antibody, 
the area inferior to this longitudinal division stained pos-
itively in the ventral parencephalon and negatively in the 
synencephalon ( 
fig. 3 
C). In tissue reacted with an anti-

 Forebrain divisions at an unsegmented stage viewed sagit-
tally. Stage 2 embryos stained with an antibody to acetylated tu-
bulin (

dinal subdivisions in either the telencephalon or diencephalon.

body to acetylcholinesterase, the parencephalon was im-
munopositive but the synencephalon was not ( 
fig. 3 
D). 
No longitudinal division separating presumptive alar 
plate from basal plate was observed with this latter anti-
body.
 
Three Segment Stage
 
Beginning at stage 5 and continuing through stage 11 
[Ferguson, 1985], the diencephalon is composed of three 
divisions with the parencephalon subdividing into an an-
terior and posterior part. Calretinin immunoreactivity 
marked the boundary separating the parencephalon an-
terior from the parencephalon posterior ( 
fig. 4 
A) as well 
as the border between the synencephalon and mesen-
cephalon ( 
fig. 4 
B). In an oblique sagittal section stained 
with an antibody to acetylated tubulin to visualize fibers, 
a band between the parencephalon anterior and posteri-
or, the zona limitans interparencephalica, was partly seen 
( 
fig. 4 
C). Although distinct borders between the paren-
cephalon posterior and synencephalon were not clear in 
tissue stained for calretinin ( 
fig. 4 A and B) or acetylated 
tubulin ( 
fig. 4 
C), fiber free zones were observed in Nissl 
stained material where three diencephalic segments were 
clearly identified ( 
fig. 4 
D). A longitudinal boundary di-
viding presumed alar from basal plate regions was most 
distinct in material stained for calretinin ( 
fig. 4 
A, B) and 
with cresyl violet ( 
fig 4 
D).
 
Tissue sectioned horizontally ( 
fig. 5 
) showed the rela-
tionship between neuromeric bulges and interneuromer-
ic ventricular ridges. This was clearest in material stained 
with peanut agglutinin ( 
fig. 5 
A) and cresyl violet ( 
fig. 5 
B). 
Borders between the diencephalon and the secondary 
prosencephalon and the mesencephalon, respectively, 
and between the three diencephalic compartments 
(parencephalon anterior, parencephalon posterior, and 
synencephalon) were present on the lateral (pial) and me-

ing longitudinally (short arrows) is seen in tissue stained with

A, B). The cell free area 
of the zona limitans interparencephalica, separating the 
parencephalon into anterior and posterior divisions, was 
distinct in cresyl violet stained material (white arrow, 
 
fig. 5 
B).
 
Four Segment Stage
 
Beginning at stage 11.5 [Ferguson, 1985], the synen-
cephalon divides into an anterior and posterior portion. 
Thus, a total of four diencephalic segments are present 
and these divisions are more evident in horizontally as 
compared to sagittally sectioned material. At stage 15 
[Ferguson, 1985], internal subdivisions were clearly seen. 
Only in sagittally sectioned material stained with an an-
tibody to vimentin ( 
fig. 6 
C) was a difference between the 
two subdivisions of the synencepalon suggested.
 
The zona limitans interparencephalica separating 
the parencephalon anterior and posterior was clearly 
seen in immunostained material using an antibody to 
acetylated tubulin ( 
fig. 6 
A, 7A) and calretinin ( 
fig. 6 
B, 
 
7 
B–D) in which both cells and fibers seem to be labeled 
( 
fig. 7 
D).
 
Differential staining using an antibody to vimentin 
suggested a transverse border ventrally between the sec-
ondary prosencephalon and parencephalon anterior. A 
border separating the synencephalon posterior and mes-
encephalon was faintly seen in calretinin immunoreac-
tive sections ( 
fig. 6 
B). Some of these intra-diencephalic

partments. The zona limitans interparencephalica (white arrow

borders were faintly observed in tissue stained with an 
antibody to vimentin ( 
fig. 6 
C). A dorsoventral division in 
sagittally sectioned brains into presumed alar and basal 
plates was most clearly visualized by calretinin immuno-
cytochemistry ( 
fig. 6 
B) and less so in cresyl violet prepa-
rations.
 
All four diencephalic divisions were observed in hori-
zontal sections. Although sharp borders marking dience-
phalic segments were not clearly seen, staining patterns 
that distinguished these compartments were apparent 
( 
fig. 8 
). Segments were most clear in peanut agglutinin 
stained sections. Using this histochemical stain, the 
thickness of the most lateral portion of the positively 
stained diencephalic mantle layer and constituent longi-
tudinal bands distinguished not only diencephalic sub-
divisions but also the boundary between the anterior 
parencephalon and secondary prosencephalon rostrally 
and between the posterior synencephalon and mesen-
cephalon caudally ( 
fig. 8 
A). Segment demarcation was 
much less well visualized with an antibody to acetylated 
tubulin ( 
fig. 8 
B) or cresyl violet staining ( 
fig. 8 
C). With 
all of these three stains, the alar parencephalon posterior 
was morphologically distinct by its similar size and shape 
( 
fig. 8 
). On this basis alone, the alar parencephalon pos-
terior could be distinguished from other alar territories. 
Differential staining properties at the ventricular and 
pial surfaces distinguished diencephalic segmental 
boundaries particularly those borders between the sec-
ondary prosencephalon and the parencephalon anterior 
and between the synencephalon posterior and the mes-
encephalon ( 
fig. 8 
).

at the three and four segment stage marked the zona lim-
itans interparencephalica and differentiated the paren-
cephalon anterior from the parencephalon posterior.
 
No longitudinal demarcation between presumptive 
alar and basal plates was seen when the diencephalon was 
unsegmented ( 
fig. 2 
). However, calretinin immunoreac-
tivity distinguished a dorsoventral division at the two 
( 
fig. 3 
C), three ( 
fig. 4 
A, B), and four ( 
fig. 6 
B) segment 
stages. At the two segment stage, fibers visualized by 
acetylated tubulin immunoreactivity (

a longitudinal division into a presumptive alar and basal 
plate.
 
Discussion
 
The present series of morphological observations ex-
amined early forebrain development in  
Alligator 
. These 
results focused on the diencephalon and its main com-
 
Compartment and Boundary Features
 
Features of diencephalic segments and their respective 
transversal borders changed over the course of early dien-
cephalon development. Similarly, overt longitudinal dif-
ferentiation between the presumptive alar and basal plate 
varied according to the stage of development. Although 
these details have been mentioned previously, they are 
summarized below and illustrated schematically ( 
fig. 9 
).
 
At the two segment stage, immunoreactivity to cal-
retinin ( 
fig. 3 
C) and acetylcholinesterase ( 
fig. 3 
D) was 
positive in the parencephalon and negative in the synen-
cephalon. Similar to compartment markers, histochemi-
cal and immunocytochemical features of borders be-
tween segments varied over time. Immunoreactivity to 
calretinin distinguished borders between the diencepha-
lon and mesencephalon regardless of whether two 
( 
fig. 3 
C), three ( 
fig. 4 
B), or four ( 
fig. 6 
B) segments were 
present. Both calretinin (

lated tubulin positive (

partments and primarily on alar (dorsal) areas. Controls 
for the immunocytochemical experiments coupled with 
the observations made on tissue processed for peanut ag-
glutinin histochemistry and Nissl staining indicate that 
the identification of forebrain compartments and their 
respective boundaries are real rather than artifactual.
 
Although the antibodies used for the immunocyto-
chemical experiments identified compartments and 
boundaries, exactly what they stained (neurons, glia, fi-
bers) was not directly addressed. It was presumed that 
acetylated tubulin stained microtubules within fibers 
[Piperno et al., 1987] and vimentin labeled radial glia 
[Tapscott et al., 1981]; however, direct confirmation of 
this was not done. Similarly, whether antibodies to cal-
retinin or acetylcholinesterase marked cells and /or glia 
was likewise not addressed. To do so would have required 
additional experiments, using for example, one marker 
for immunocytochemistry (e.g., antibody to calretinin) 
and a second for neurons or glia. Moreover, immunore-
activity varied over time making an answer to this ques-
tion even more complicated. Data presented previously 
suggest that at later stages calretinin labels both cells and 
fibers ( 
fig. 7 
D). Regardless, the goal of this study was to 
trace the development of the diencephalon from a single 
compartment into subdivisions until each segment be-
came internally subdivided. The exact structure(s) that 
various antibodies labeled at different times during de-
velopment should not detract from the present analysis. 
Furthermore, the observations made on material stained 
for peanut agglutinin and for cresyl violet provided inde-
pendent support for the immunocytochemical findings.
 
The plane of section employed was critical not only for 
the observations made in this study but also for compar-
isons with similar experiments done in other vertebrates. 
Tissue sectioned transversally (perpendicular to either 
the sagittal or horizontal plane used in the present analy-
sis) was useful only for documentation of the zona limi-
tans interparencephalica ( 
fig. 7 
C, D). The sagittal and 
horizontal planes of sections used in this analysis have 
been illustrated in a representative external view of an 
 
Alligator 
 brain divided at the isthmus ( 
fig. 1 
). Neverthe-
less, some distortion inevitably occurred related to freez-
ing, tissue preservation, the amount of external tissue 
surrounding the brain, and differential brain growth 
during development resulting in some deviation from the 
planned plane of section. This could have influenced the 
interpretation of sectioned material. It was for this reason 
that the tissue was analyzed in both sagittal and horizon-
tal planes to confirm observations and minimize misin-
terpretations. Even obliquely sectioned material proved 
useful in analyzing forebrain compartments and borders. 
In this way, the natural curvature of examined neural tis-
sue would not give a false appearance to the observed di-
encephalic compartments.
 
In  
Alligator 
, clear and reliable subdivisions subsequent 
to formation of the most rostral forebrain area known as 
the secondary prosencephalon [Rendahl, 1924; Puelles et 
al., 1987] regardless of the plane of section (sagittal, hori-
zontal, or transverse) were not seen. On the other hand, 
the developing diencephalon clearly transforms from an 
initial single compartment into various subdivisions rel-
ative to both the dorsoventral and rostrocaudal axes. The 
diencephalon first divides transversely into the paren-

cephalon and the synencephalon. Subsequently, the 
parencephalon splits into an anterior and a posterior 
compartment with the appearance of the zona limitans 
interparencephalica. Still later in development, the syn-
encephalon becomes divided into anterior and posterior 
subdivisions. Later in ontogeny, internal divisions are 
formed within specific compartments. In addition, when 
the diencephalon divides into two transverse zones and 
continuing throughout the period of development stud-
ied in this report, a longitudinal division along a dorso-
ventral axis identified a presumptive alar and basal plate. 
However, borders separating compartments within the 
alar plate were more readily recognized than those in the 
basal plate.

documented subdivisions in the diencephalon early in

ontogeny (see  
table 1 
). However, besides the present ob-
servations, investigations of early diencephalon develop-
ment beginning at a single compartment stage are few. 
Most have used chick [Vaage, 1969; Puelles et al, l987; 
Larsen et al., 2001] whereas one study investigated hu-
mans [Müller and O’Rahilly, 1997]. Observations in these 
four studies were based on living embryos [Vaage, 1969]; 
fixed tissue whole mounts including wax-plate recon-
structions [Vaage, 1969]; scanning electron microscope 
images [Larsen et al., 2001]; sectioned material using a 
variety of stains labeling cells [Vaage, 1969; Müller and 
O’Rahilly; 1997; Larsen et al., 2001]; including graphical 
reconstructions [Müller and O’Rahilly, 1997]; histochem-
ical staining of acetylcholinesterase positive neuroblasts 
in whole mount and sectioned material [Puelles et al., 
1987]; immunocytochemistry on whole mount and sec-
tioned material [Larsen et al., 2001]; in situ hybridization 
[Puelles and Rubenstein, 1993, Larsen et al., 2001]; bro-
modeoxyuridine labeling [Larsen et al., 2001]; and dex-
tran labeling [Larsen et al., 2001]. Although some com-
mon techniques were used (e.g., Nissl staining), the his-
tochemical and immunocytochemical markers in the 
present experiments differed in part from those of others 
[Vaage, 1969; Puelles et al., 1987; Müller and O’Rahilly, 
1997; Larsen et al., 2001]. Nevertheless, the present obser-
vations in  
Alligator 
 are largely consistent with the obser-
vations in chick [Vaage, 1969; Puelles et al., 1987; Larsen 
et al., 2001] and humans [Müller and O’Rahilly, 1997] at 
least in documenting division of a single diencephalic 
proto-segment into the parencephalon and synencepha-
lon and subsequent further separation of the parenceph-
alon into an anterior and posterior component. The pres-
ent study and others [Vaage, 1969; Larsen et al., 2001] 
described further parcellation of the synencephalon into 
an anterior and posterior portion whereas other studies 
[Puelles et al., 1987; Müller and O’Rahilly, 1997] have rec-
ognized only a single compartment. In humans [Müller 
and O’Rahilly, 1997], the diencephalon was divided into 
two parts: D1and D2. In the present analysis, only the D2 
compartment [Müller and O’Rahilly, 1997] is comparable 
to the diencephalon of chick [Vaage, 1969; Puelles et al., 
1987; Larsen et al., 2001] and  
Alligator 
 [present study]. D1 
in this schema [Müller and O’Rahilly, 1997] encompasses 
the optic chiasm and, in the definition of many [Nieu-
wenhuys, 1998a], would be considered a part of the sec-
ondary prosencephalon rather than part of the dienceph-
alon proper [Puelles, 1995; Puelles and Rubenstein, 1993, 
2003]. Although methodology for identification differs, 
the zona limitans interparencephalica separating the 
parencephalon anterior and posterior in chick [Rendahl, 
1924; Puelles et al., 1987] lies in a similar topographical 
position and extent as observed in  
Alligator 
 [present 
study]. In addition, although techniques differed, the ap-
proximate location of the separation between the pre-
sumptive alar and basal plate in chick diencephalon [Pu-
elles et al., 1987] is similar in position to that seen in  
Al-
ligator 
 [present study].
 
A comparison between the onset of diencephalic seg-
mentation and the vertebrate groups in which detailed 
descriptions of early development are available is present-

. Development in  
Alligator 
 [Ferguson, 1985] 
as well as chick [Hamburger and Hamilton, 1951] varies 
depending on temperature. At 30 
  ° 
  C, hatching occurs in 
 
Alligator 
 after 62–67 days [Ferguson, 1985]. In chick, it 
occurs at 20–21 days [Hamburger and Hamilton, 1951]. 
At these early stages of diencephalon development, chick 
stages are approximated in hours based on the classical 
descriptions of Hamburger and Hamilton [1951]. How-
ever, according to their description, stages 14 to 35 eggs 
were kept at 39.4 
  ° 
  C whereas eggs from the other stages 
were kept at 37.5 
  ° 
  C [Hamburger and Hamilton, 1951]. 
Presumably, temperature and species of chick did not in-
fluence staging although these factors might have im-
pacted the conversion to hours after egg laying. In  
Alliga-
tor 
, the time of egg deposition was occasionally impre-
cise. This did not influence staging but would have an 
effect on time after presumed egg deposition. At stage 8 
and before, the day after egg laying and stage correspond; 
thereafter, stage and egg age vary. Based on data from 
Ferguson [1985], stage 11.5 occurs at day 12.5. My obser-
vations are in agreement with this. Bearing in mind these 
potential sources of variation, comparisons among  
Alli-
gator 
 [present study], chick [Vaage, 1969; Puelles et al., 
1987; Larsen et al., 2001], and humans [Müller and 
O’Rahilly, 1997] provide a time frame for compartment 
and boundary formation in the diencephalon in relation 
to gestation ( 
table 2 
). In mice, in which gestation is 19–21 
days, a comparable sequence of diencephalon develop-
ment is lacking. Unpublished observations state that ‘di-
encephalic neuromeres appear at 9–11 days post coitum 
and are comparable to their chick counterparts’ [Figdor 
and Stern, 1993, p. 633].
 
One difference between the present observations and 
those which described early diencephalon development 
in chick and humans is whether the synencephalon re-
mains a single unit [Puelles et al., 1987; Müller and 
O’Rahilly, 1997] or divides into two [Vaage, 1969; Larsen 
et al., 2001]. The present observations in  
Alligator 
 suggest 
that the synencephalon divides into an anterior and pos-
terior segment. Furthermore, others have provided ex-
perimental data to support a division into anterior and 
posterior components [Figdor and Stern, 1993; Larsen et 
al., 2001]. Nevertheless, the vast majority of studies using 
a variety of techniques recognize only a single division 
( 
table 1 
). It is likely that methods other than the morpho-
logic ones used in the present analysis will be required to 
settle this issue.
 
Although further diencephalic development in  
Alliga-
tor 
 has yet to be investigated in detail, it is likely that these 
early alar subdivisions will follow a pattern similar to that 
described for other vertebrates. Viewed from this per-
spective, the parencephalon anterior is destined to be-
come the ventral thalamus [Figdor and Stern, 1993; Nieu-
wenhuys, 1998a; Larsen et al., 2001] or prethalamus [Pu-
elles and Rubenstein, 2003]; the parencephalon posterior 
is the presumptive dorsal thalamus [Rubenstein et al., 
1994; Larsen et al., 2001] and epithalamus [Figdor and 
Stern, 1993; Puelles and Rubenstein, 1993; Nieuwenhuys, 
1998a] or thalamus [Puelles and Rubenstein, 2003]; and 
the synencephalon is the anlage for the pretectum [Nieu-
wenhuys, 1998a; Larsen et al., 2001; Puelles and Ruben-
stein, 2003]. When two divisions of the synencephalon 
are recognized, the anterior compartment will become 
the pretectum anterior whereas the posterior division is 
the presumptive pretectum posterior [Figdor and Stern, 
1993].
 
The separation between the parencephalon anterior 
and the parencephalon posterior is occupied by the zona 
limitans interparencephalica. Although the zona limi-
tans interparencephalica might correspond to part or all 
of the zona limitans intrathalamica, additional markers 
used by others [Figdor and Stern, 1993; Zeltser et al., 2001; 
Kiecker and Lumsden, 2004; Scholpp et al., 2006] will be 
required to confirm such a relationship. Nevertheless, 
several reports have suggested that this region itself is a 
separate compartment [Figdor and Stern, 1993; Larsen et 
al., 2001; Zeltser et al., 2001; Kiecker and Lumsden, 2004; 
Zeltser, 2005] although a general consensus has not been 
reached [Puelles and Rubenstein, 2003]. The purely mor-
phological data obtained by the present observations 
cannot determine if this is indeed the case. In addition, 
specifics as to the status and morphology of the roof plate, 
epichordal strip, and floor plate [Vaage, 1969; Puelles et 
al., 1987; Puelles, 1995; Puelles and Rubenstein, 2003] 
were not examined in detail in this analysis.
 
The present series of morphological experiments 
traced diencephalon development in the transverse plane 
from a single segment into four compartments until in-
dividual zones undergo internal subdivisions. These 
components are most clearly seen in the presumptive alar 
plate and are less distinct in the presumptive basal plate 
region. A number of terms to describe these divisions 
have been employed previously and used interchange-
ably: compartments, zones, segments, subdivisions, re-
gions, and areas. However, neuromeres and their fore-
brain counterparts, prosomeres, have been avoided be-
cause these terms have taken on different meanings and 
interpretation since their introduction into the English 
language literature by Orr in 1887. In his original descrip-
tion, Orr defined neuromeres by their morphological ap-
 
Alligator

pearance stating that ‘…Each neuromere is separated 
from its neighbors by an external dorso-ventral constric-
tion, and opposite this an internal sharp dorso-ventral 
ridge, – so that each neuromere (i.e., one lateral half of 
each) appears as a small arc of a circle. The constrictions 
are exactly opposite on each side of the brain…’ [Orr, 
1887, p. 335]. By this definition, the identified segments 
in the present report most clearly seen in horizontal sec-
tions (see  
fig. 5 
 and  
8 
) are indeed neuromeres.
 
However, others researchers [Keynes and Lumsden, 
1990; Lumsden, 1990] have suggested that several criteria 
need to be met if a neuromere is to be of developmental 
significance. The observations in the present analysis ful-
fill only one of these four features [Keynes and Lumsden, 
1990; Lumsden, 1990]; namely, that compartments follow 
a segmental pattern. The other three criteria, which were 
not addressed in this paper, are the following. First, neu-
romeres are preceded or produced by a segmental pattern 
of cell proliferation. Second, borders between neuromeres 
should be barriers to cell mixing and, therefore, should 
create lineage restrictions. Third, putative regulatory 
genes should be expressed in patterns that relate to the 
neuromere(s) being investigated. These features have been 
studied most intensely in the developing chick hindbrain 
where rhombomeres satisfy these criteria [for review, see 
Lumsden, 2004; Kiecker and Lumsden, 2005]. Extending 
this approach to the forebrain in general, and to the dien-
cephalon in particular, has resulted in somewhat different 
interpretations [Figdor and Stern, 1993; Larsen et al., 2001; 
Puelles and Rubenstein, 2003]. Although a recent review 
[Lim and Golden, 2007] has partly examined these differ-
ences, the following is a detailed summary of these three 
analyses of diencephalon development.
 
The first researchers to examine this problem using 
methodology to address the four criteria to determine 
whether neuromeres in the diencephalon were of devel-
opmental significance were Figdor and Stern [1993]. They 
used the following methods: scanning electron micros-
copy; histochemical and immunocytochemical stains 
with light microscopic analysis; fluorescent tracer injec-
tion into a single neuroepithelial cell and similar injec-
tions into small groups of cells within diencephalic neu-
romeres; and expression domains of several putative
regulatory genes in chick. They concluded that the dien-
cephalon was organized into four cellular domains that 
form in precise sequence with characteristic shapes in 
which boundaries between neuromeres represent lineage 
restrictions with certain putative regulatory genes corre-
sponding to borders and individual diencephalic seg-
ments. Furthermore, specific fiber tracts formed bound-
aries between segments. In this scheme, the four dience-
phalic compartments were labeled D1 to D4, and 
corresponded to the parencephalon anterior (D1), paren-
cephalon posterior (D2), synencephalon anterior (D3), 
and synencephalon posterior (D4). The hypothalamus 
was considered part of D1 in this analysis.
 
This problem was re-investigated in chick by Larsen et 
al. [2001] using many of the same techniques (morphol-
ogy, gene expression, cell lineage restriction, acquisition 
of boundary specific phenotype) employed by Figdor and 
Stern [1993]. However, Larsen et al. [2001] obtained re-
sults different from those of Figdor and Stern [1993] and 
thus reached different conclusions regarding diencepha-
lon compartment development [Larsen et al., 2001]. When 
the diencephalon was divided into two units, the paren-
cephalon and synencephalon, only the synencephalon 
exhibited neuromeric characters at its interface with the 
midbrain. The synencephalic/parencephalic border did 
not restrict cell mixing nor did the parencephalon/sec-
ondary prosencephalon boundary. When the parenceph-
alon became divided into anterior and posterior parts by 
the zona limitans intrathalamica, neither division exhib-
ited neuromeric morphology nor did these compart-
ments display lineage restriction at their boundaries. 
When the synencephalon became subdivided as deter-
mined by tissue morphology and differential gene ex-
pression, neither cell lineage restriction nor cell bound-
ary phenotype were observed. In addition, S-phase nuclei 
(as determined by bromodeoxyuridine labeling), which 
are localized apically at rhombomere borders, were found 
at this location only in the zona limitans intrathalamica 
and at the synencephalon/mesencephalon border. They 
concluded that the diencephalon did not display a seg-
mental pattern of development [Larsen et al., 2001]. On 
the other hand, recent fate mapping experiments in chick 
[Garcia-Lopez et al., 2004] found that both alar and bas-
al parts of each of the diencephalic segments showed neu-
roepithelial cell restriction at inter-segmental boundar-
ies. However, the interpretation of orthotopic mapping of 
cell fates is open to potential criticism from two sources. 
One limitation is the size of the grafts. The other is the 
potential change in cellular behavior that might occur as 
a result of injury to embryonic donor tissue and the sub-
sequent integration of the graft [Kiecker and Lumsden, 
2005].
 
The third interpretation, the prosomeric model, put 
forth by Puelles, Rubenstein and co-workers, was initial-
ly based on morphological observations in chick [Puelles 
et al., 1987] and subsequently extended to other verte-
brates [Puelles and Rubenstein, 2003]. These observa-
 
Pritz

tions were heavily influenced by gene expression map-
ping. As additional markers became available, re-evalua-
tions of the territories and boundaries of prosomere 1 
(synencephalon), prosomere 2 (parencephalon posteri-
or), and prosomere 3 (parencephalon anterior) have oc-
curred and these zones have been re-defined. This para-
digm is subject to further modification as new data be-
come available [Puelles and Rubenstein, 2003]. However, 
the prosomeric model was an approach to correlate mor-
phological observations with gene expression data [Pu-
elles and Rubenstein, 2003]. Other developmentally sig-
nificant features of neuromeres have yet to be investigat-
ed by this group.
 
The present experiments, by their very nature, cannot 
determine which of these interpretations is most accu-
rate. Nevertheless, the identification of the time course 
and pattern of formation of diencephalic subdivisions 
from a single compartment in  
Alligator 
 into four trans-
verse zones provides a roadmap for future investigations 
to examine other developmentally significant properties 
of these regions.
 
Divisions of the secondary prosencephalon in  
Alliga-
tor 
 early in development were obscure whereas boundar-
ies and compartments in the diencephalon were much 
more readily identifiable. The presence of secondary 
prosencephalic subdivisions in vertebrates has been a 
matter of dispute [for summary, see Nieuwenhuys, 1998a; 
Striedter, 2005]. Even those who have proposed segments 
within this part of the forebrain have subsequently mod-
ified their interpretation as additional data became avail-
able. Initially, based on the appearance of acetylcholines-
terase positive neuroblasts, secondary prosencephalic 
subdivisions were not described [Puelles et al., 1987]. Lat-
er, investigations that examined certain gene expression 
patterns postulated transverse regions within the sec-
ondary prosencephalon [Puelles and Rubenstein, 1993; 
Rubenstein et al., 1994; Puelles, 1995, 2001]. Most recent-
ly, molecularly distinct transverse regions of the second-
ary prosencephalon were best interpreted as secondary, 
non-neuromeric subdivisions because interneuromeric 
boundaries did not extend from the roof plate to the floor 
plate [Puelles and Rubenstein, 2003]. Accordingly, gene 
expression data rather than the purely morphological ob-
servations made here will be necessary if secondary pros-
encephalic transverse regions are to be identified in  
Al-
ligator. 
 
Regardless of whether or not the synencephalon sub-
sequently becomes subdivided, the overall pattern of ear-
ly diencephalon formation observed in mammals [hu-
mans: Müller and O’Rahilly, 1997] birds [chick: Vaage, 
1969; Puelles et al., 1987; Larsen et al., 2001], and reptiles 
[ 
Alligator 
: present study] is similar. These observations 
suggest that the initial building blocks of the diencepha-
lon follow a common plan in all amniotes and perhaps in 
other vertebrates as well. It remains, however, to be deter-
mined how subsequent development produces different 
adult diencephalons in various species. Identification of 
key stage specific morphological changes that distinguish 
the  
Alligator 
 diencephalon from that of closely and dis-
tantly related species should serve as a starting point to 
investigate what molecular events are responsible for 
these differences.
