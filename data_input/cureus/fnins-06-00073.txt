The anatomic complexity of the diencephalon depends on precise molecular and cellular
regulative mechanisms orchestrated by regional morphogenetic organizers at the neural
tube stage. In the diencephalon, like in other neural tube regions, dorsal and ventral signals
codify positional information to specify ventro-dorsal regionalization. Retinoic acid, Fgf8,
BMPs, and Wnts signals are the molecular factors acting upon the diencephalic epithelium
to specify dorsal structures, while Shh is the main ventralizing signal. A central diencephalic
organizer, the zona limitans intrathalamica (ZLI), appears after neurulation in the central
diencephalic alar plate, establishing additional antero-posterior positional information inside
diencephalic alar plate. Based on Shh expression, the ZLI acts as a morphogenetic cen-
ter, which cooperates with other signals in thalamic speciﬁcation and pattering in the alar
plate of diencephalon. Indeed, Shh is expressed ﬁrst in the basal plate extending dorsally
through the ZLI epithelium as the development proceeds. Despite the importance of ZLI in
diencephalic morphogenesis the mechanisms that regulate its development remain incom-
pletely understood. Actually, controversial interpretations in different experimental models
have been proposed. That is, experimental results have suggested that (i) the juxtaposi-
tion of the molecularly heterogeneous neuroepithelial areas, (ii) cell reorganization in the
epithelium, and/or (iii) planar and vertical inductions in the neural epithelium, are required
for ZLI speciﬁcation and development.We will review some experimental data to approach
the study of the molecular regulation of diencephalic regionalization, with special interest
in the cellular mechanisms underlying planar inductions.

INTRODUCTION
The formation of the neural tube, a process called neurula-
tion, requires a precise combination of inductive signals from
local signaling centers, the primary organizers (e.g., the node
and anterior visceral endoderm), which regulate the polarity
of the embryo and brain primordium growth. These signals
code positional information that, at the cellular level, is trans-
lated into differential proliferation and intercalative cell move-
ments (Sanchez-Arrones et al., 2012), which ﬁnally will deﬁne
the regional morphogenesis of the neural epithelium. Once the
neural tube is formed, secondary organizers reﬁne the histoge-
nesis of the brain primordium, governing forebrain, midbrain
and hindbrain regional and sub-regional differentiation (Jes-
sell and Sanes, 2000; Colas and Schoenwolf, 2001). Morpho-
genetic signals in the prosencephalon are molecules that belong
to four genetic families: Wingless-Int protein family (Wnt; Dick-
inson and McMahon, 1992), Hedgehog family (Hh; Echelard
et al., 1993), Bone morphogenetic protein family (Bmp; Kings-
ley, 1994) and Fibroblast growth factor family (Fgf; Crossley
and Martin, 1995), which confer positional identity to differ-
ent cellular populations distributed in compartments or domains
along the neural tube wall. The temporo-spatial distribution
of these signals at early developmental stages is therefore cru-
cial for the governing brain morphogenesis and neural fate
speciﬁcation.
REGIONALIZATION OF THE NEURAL TUBE: LONGITUDINAL
AND TRANSVERSE ORGANIZATION
Early after neurulation, three primary vesicles in the anterior
neural tube can be observed. These are known as the forebrain
(prosencephalon), which becomes subdivided into the anterior
secondary prosencephalon (telencephalon, optic vesicles, and
hypothalamus) and the diencephalon (revised in Martinez et al.,
2012); caudally we have the midbrain (mesencephalon) and hind-
brain (rhombencephalon), which continued caudally with the
spinal cord.
In the last century, embryologists interpreted the localiza-
tion and developmental signiﬁcance of anatomical reliefs in the
neural tube wall (bulges, ventricular furrows, and ridges) in
different ways. Two major morphological paradigms emerged
and have competed for primacy to interpret the morphogenetic
processes underlying neural plate and tube regionalization (see
for extensive reviews Nieuwenhuys, 1998, 2011; Puelles, 2001;
and citations therein). Since these interpretative discrepancies
have been especially evident in diencephalic patterning, we will
review some relevant assumptions and conclusions postulated
in each one to understand diencephalic development. On the
one hand, the columnar paradigm, instituted by Herrick (1910),
is a regional-topographic model that distinguishes four super-
posed longitudinal diencephalic domains or columns (Alvarez-
Bolado et al., 1995; Swanson, 2003) called from dorsal to ventral

direction: epithalamus, thalamus, ventral thalamus, and hypothal-
amus. These divisions extend functional columns of the mesen-
cephalon and rhombencephalon into the prosencephalon. In this
model the brain axis ends in the telencephalon and passes longi-
tudinally through the hypothalamus, which is conceived to be a
ventral part of the diencephalon. On the other hand, we have the
prosomeric model, originally postulated by Bergquist (1932), and
recently revised by Rubenstein et al. (1994) and Puelles and Ruben-
stein (2003), which is a widely accepted interpretational paradigm
to compare anatomical, molecular (gene transcription patterns),
and experimental data. Interestingly, homeobox-gene expression
patterns and lineage restriction experiments also support the
notion that prosomeres are developmental entities (segments;
Scholpp and Lumsden, 2010; Puelles et al., 2012).
Gene expression patterns reveal neuroepithelial boundaries
that segregate cell domains with similar molecular properties.
Thus, the diencephalon can be subdivided into four longitudi-
nal columnar territories, which from ventral to dorsal are the ﬂoor
plate, basal plate, alar plate, and roof plate (which are also present
along the whole neural tube); and into three transverse segments
or prosomeres (prethalamus or p3, thalamus or p2, and pretec-
tum or p1, from anterior to posterior). Caudal segments where
called mesomeres, in the mesencephalon, and rhombomeres, in
the rhombencephalon (Nieuwenhuys, 1998, 2011; Puelles, 2001).
In the prosomeric model hypothalamus and telencephalon are
respectively the basal and alar derivatives of the most anterior
neural region: the secondary prosencephalon. In contrast, in the
columnar model: (i) the hypothalamus is classiﬁed together with
ventral thalamus as anterior diencephalon and represents the ven-
tral diencephalic column; and (ii) the telencephalon is conceived
as the rostral continuation of dorsal diencephalic columns (also
classiﬁed as caudal diencephalon; Swanson, 2003; Figure 1A).
Throughout this review, we follow the prosomeric interpreta-
tion and treat the hypothalamus as a basal plate derivative of the
secondary prosencephalon and not as a part of the diencephalon.
Therefore, the prosomeric model proposes that dorso-vental
(DV) and antero-posterior (A-P) patterning subdivides the neural
tube into distinct neuroepithelial ﬁelds: segments and columns,
which are respectively separated by transversal and longitudinal
boundaries. Morphogenetic information coded by inductive sig-
nals deﬁnes locally speciﬁc patterns of genetic expressions in these
territories. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments, together with
gene expression data, support the idea that: (1) lateral (dorsal)
signaling is regulated by members of the TGF-β superfamily, such
as Bmp4 and Bmp7, and by Wnt family members (Basler et al.,
1993; Dickinson et al., 1995; Liem et al., 1995; Shimamura and
Rubenstein, 1997; Lee and Jessell, 1999), (2) patterning of the
ventral part is regulated mainly by Shh and Nkx2.2 (Price et al.,
1992; Echelard et al., 1993; Shimamura et al., 1995), and ﬁnally,
(3) antero-posterior patterning (A-P) is regulated by signaling
centers identiﬁed at various boundary regions in the vertebrate
neural tube (revised in Martinez, 2001; Echevarria et al., 2003;
Vieira et al., 2010). These A-P signaling centers, also known as
secondary organizers, are: the anterior neural ridge (ANR) at the
anterior end of the neural plate/tube (Houart et al., 1998), the
zona limitans intrathalamica (ZLI) in the middle of the dien-
cephalon (Larsen et al., 2001; Echevarria et al., 2003), and the

isthmic organizer (IsO) at the mid-hindbrain boundary (Cross-
ley et al., 1996; Figure 1B). Although the molecular nature of
signals may be different in each one of these secondary organiz-
ers, they share common basic characteristics: (i) organizers are a
source of signaling molecules that codify positional information
specifying cellular identities in neighboring regions, and (ii) this
molecular information regulates the expression of other genes,
mainly transcription factors, conferring speciﬁc cell fate prop-
erties to neuroepithelial cells. The combination of medio-lateral
and antero-posterior inductive inﬂuences generates a 2D grid-
like organization that is transformed, by the developmental time
and morphogenetic movements, into a 3D framework translating
the molecular code (positional information) into brain structure.
We could consider that the evolutionary advantage of segmenta-
tion resides in its modular structure, distributing cell populations
into functional units (Davis and Patel, 1999; Ten Tusscher and
Hogeweg, 2011), which show properties of morphogenetic ﬁelds:
developmental autonomy and potential of histogenetic regulation
(revised by De Robertis et al., 1991).
PATTERNING AND HISTOGENESIS OF THE DEVELOPING
DIENCEPHALON
At each stage of development, the expressed genes in a neural
region represent the state of its molecular speciﬁcation. Thus,
these gene expression patterns characterize the regional subdivi-
sions (or molecular regionalization) of the brain, by regulating the
main histogenetic processes such as proliferation, migration, dif-
ferentiation,and establishment of neuronal connections. The ﬁnal
result of the neural regionalization is the establishment of anatom-
ical regions with speciﬁc programs of structural and functional
maturation.

Regulation of diencephalic regionalization
The prosomeric diencephalon (or caudal diencephalon) is
a complex region in the central area of the vertebrate brain,
located between the secondary prosencephalon and the midbrain
(Figure 1A). The morphologic segmentation in the mouse dien-
cephalon starts at E9.5 (corresponding to HH14 in chick embryos)
and continues during the next 2–3 days. At E10–11 (HH19 in
chick embryos), the diencephalic prosomeres are morphologically
apparent as ventricular ridges and lateral wall bulges (Puelles,
2001). Then, diencephalic regionalization progresses when the
expression of several genes into deﬁned alar or basal territories (as
is the case forWnt3a,Gbx2,and Sox14) precedes the histogenesis of
prethalamic (p3), thalamic (p2), and pretectal (p1) nuclear masses
in the alar plate,as well as segmental-corresponding domains (p3-,
p2-,and p1-teg;Figures2 and 3) in the basal plate.At E12.5 (HH28
in chick embryos), the diencephalon presents a complete segmen-
tal structure (Figure 3A; Puelles et al., 2008, 2012; Suzuki-Hirano
et al., 2010).
Morphological and experimental data showed a discontinu-
ous neurogenic pattern in the diencephalon at neural tube stage,
developing the concept of migration areas, by Bergquist and
Kallen (1954), and neurogenic territories by Puelles et al. (1987),
in agreement to segmental theories and against prevalent inter-
pretations of functional columns in brain morphogenesis. For
instance, Altman and Bayer (1988a,b,c, 1989a,b,c) interpreted
cell birthdates and topography of thalamic nuclei as relevant
information to determine progenitor position in the neuroep-
ithelium, postulating a lobular model of diencephalic patterning
under the columnar framework. Recent work analyzing molec-
ular identities of neuroepithelial progenitors, together with the
establishment of topological references and experimental embry-
ology approaches generated new evidences in favor of the pro-
someric interpretation of diencephalic patterning. Actually, stud-
ies using scanning electron microscopy and clonal analysis after
neuroepithelial labeling on chick embryos, led Figdor and Stern
(1993) to subdivide the diencephalon into four transverse domains
called diencephalic neuromeres (D1–D4). Later on, studies based
upon expression proﬁles of transcription factors and immunocy-
tochemical staining for cell adhesion molecules conﬁrmed and
extended the segmental character of diencephalic alar plate in
chick and mouse embryos (reviewed in Simeone et al., 1992;
Larsen et al., 2001; Kataoka and Shimogori, 2008). It is now
widely accepted that the diencephalon is formed by three pro-
someres subdivided into alar and basal plate portions. We have
already described these diencephalic units as prosomere 1 (p1),
prosomere 2 (p2), and prosomere 3 (p3; Puelles and Ruben-
stein, 2003). These units comprise the following structures in
their alar and roof plates: the pretectum (p1), the thalamus
and epithalamus (which contains the habenula and the pineal
gland; p2), and the prethalamus and prethalamic eminence (p3).
In their basal plates, these prosomeres contain structures that
are classiﬁed as retromammillary area and prerubral tegmentum
in mammals and birds, and posterior tubercular structures in
anamniotes like Xenopus and zebraﬁsh (Bergquist, 1932; Puelles
et al., 1996, 2007, 2012; Wullimann and Puelles, 1999; Garcia-
Lopez et al., 2004; Osório et al., 2010; Martinez et al., 2012;
Figures 2B–D and 3A).
STRUCTURAL ORGANIZATION AND FUNCTION OF THE
DIENCEPHALON
The diencephalon functions as a relay structure that receives and
ﬁlters afferent sensory information, relaying it on to the cerebral
cortex.
As we have described previously, during embryogenesis each
diencephalic division can be characterized by the expression of
speciﬁc genes,coding for regulatory proteins,morphogenetic mol-
ecules or other molecular markers (Puelles et al., 1987; Puelles and
Rubenstein, 1993; Stoykova and Gruss, 1994; Redies, 1995; Redies
et al., 2000; Kataoka and Shimogori, 2008; Suzuki-Hirano et al.,
2010). Neurons are born in the ventricular epithelium and migrate
to the mantle layer, where they aggregate into thalamic nuclei at
different radial distances creating periventricular, intermediate, or
superﬁcial nuclear masses, which are connected through axonal
ﬁbers in order to integrate functional systems.
PROSOMERE 1: PRETECTUM
In birds Rendahl (1924) and Keyser (1972), distinguished two
subdivisions in the pretectum. The rostral p1 is known as pre-
commissural pretectum (PTp), extends in front of the posterior
commissure and behind the p2 where the retroﬂex tract follows
p2/p1 limit. The caudal subdivision of p1 is related to the pos-
terior commissure, and it is known as commissural pretectum
(PTc). Later, a third subdomain was described between the com-
missural and precommissural pretectum, which was called yuxta
commissural pretectum (PTy; Puelles et al., 1996; Redies et al.,
1997). Additional studies on cadherins expression in the avian
diencephalon (Redies and Takeichi, 1996; Redies, 2000; Puelles
et al.,2007) and immunohistochemical studies with anti-calbindin
and anti-calretinin in mammals (Martinez and Puelles,2000) sup-
ported these three subdivision of the p1 alar plate. Recently, an
exhaustive analysis of pretectal molecular regionalization and his-
togenesis (or genoarchitecture) has been developed by Luis Puelles’
group in chick embryos (Ferran et al., 2008, 2009), extending
pretectal molecular regionalization up to nuclear organization.
Pretectal structures are involved in the regulation of the informa-
tion coming from the visual system and the establishment of visual
reﬂexes.
Basal structures in p1 include: the anterior pole of ventral
tegmental area (VTA) and substance nigra (SN; Puelles et al.,
2004, 2007, 2012), which are involved in controlling movement, as
well as the interstitial nucleus of Cajal (IC), which is functionally
involved in head orientation reﬂexes (Garcia-Lopez et al., 2004;
Figure 3A).

subdivided into rostral (cTh-R) and caudal (cTh-C) subdomains
in relation to differential expression patterns of developmental
genes in mouse embryos (Blackshaw et al., 2010; Shimogori et al.,
2010). In addition to the function as a relay of the sensorial
information in its way to the cortex, the thalamus, together with
the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum, is neutrally linked to the

formed the retroﬂexus tract, very well characterized in mouse and
zebraﬁsh (Aizawa et al., 2005; Hikosaka et al., 2008; Matsumoto
and Hikosaka,2008,2009). The pineal gland or epiphysis,remnant
of an ancient and complex light-sensitive system, controls the cir-
cadian internal clock by secreting melatonin (Falcón et al., 2009).
Moreover, other processes controlled by the epithalamus are: pain
processing and stress responses (Andres et al., 1999).
The thalamic nuclei are named and classiﬁed in mammals
according to their positions within the thalamus and by their
function (Figure 3A; Puelles et al., 2007). According to their topo-
graphic position,the thalamic nuclei are detailed as follows (Jones,
2006;Puellesetal.,2012).Theanteriornuclei(AN)of thalamusare
collection of nuclei at the rostral pole of the thalamus (the caudal
thalamus by Kataoka and Shimogori,2008; Shimogori et al.,2010),
playing a role in modulation of alertness, as well as in learning
and memory (Jones, 2006; Puelles et al., 2012). The ventral ante-
rior (VA) and ventral lateral (VL) thalamic nuclei are involved
with motor function. The ventral posterior nucleus, posterolat-
eral, and posteromedial (VPL, VPM) are relating to the sensorial
systems. The medial dorsal thalamic nuclei (MD) are involved
with emotional arousal and the expression of emotionally based
behavior,as well as memory and feelings of pleasure. Furthermore,
the intramedular and centromedian thalamic nuclei (CM) regu-
late excitability levels within the cerebral cortex playing a major

role in arousal and alertness in tune with the circadian rhythm.
Moreover, impulses from the auditory structures synapse in the
medial geniculate thalamic nuclei (MGN), where they are sent to
the auditory centers of the cerebral cortex. Finally, impulses from
the ganglion cells in the retina, via the optic nerves, synapse in
the lateral geniculate thalamic nuclei (LGN), where visual infor-
mation is processed and sent on to the visual areas of the cerebral
cortex.
Basal derivatives are the interstitial rostral nucleus (IR),
involved in visual orientation reﬂexes, and the most anterior areas
of the VTA and the substantia nigra (SN; Garcia-Lopez et al.,
2004; Puelles et al., 2004, 2007, 2012), together with other reticular
populations in the basal plate (Figure 3A).
PROSOMER 3: PRETHALAMUS AND PRETHALAMIC EMINENCE
The prethalamus (formerly ventral thalamus) is a heterogeneous
constellation of nuclear groups, which have been molecularly well
deﬁned in mouse (Shimogori et al., 2010; Puelles et al., 2012),
in chicken (Garcia-Lopez et al., 2004), in zebraﬁsh (Wullimann
and Puelles, 1999; Mueller et al., 2006; Staudt and Houart, 2007),
and in Xenopus (Bachy et al., 2001; Domínguez et al., 2010). The
reticular thalamic nucleus (Rt), ventral lateral geniculate nucleus
(VLG), subgeniculate nucleus (SG), and zona incerta (ZI), are
the main prethalamic derivatives. In addition the intergeniculate
leaﬂet (IGL), together with the caudal pole of VLG represent the
derivatives of ZLI progenitors (Delaunay et al., 2009), and have
been grouped as derivatives of the ZLI and anterior p2 domain
(or rostral part of the caudal thalamus cTh-R) which is dependent
on Fgf8 signaling (Kataoka and Shimogori, 2008; Shimogori et al.,
2010). The major feature of prethalamic connections is the lack of
projections to the cerebral cortex. Unlike the thalamus, it develops
efferent connections to the striatum, red nucleus, and substantia
nigra. Moreover, Rt,VLG, SG, and ZI connect with other thalamic
nuclei, modulating all incoming and outgoing information of the
dorsal thalamus. The IGL receives direct retinal afferences and is
connected with the suprachiasmatic nuclei,which is important for
circadian regulation (Puelles et al., 2007).
Furthermore, other alar structures in the p3 include: the
prethalamic eminence (PThE) located dorsally to the prethalamus
and the choroid plexus (cpx) in the roof plate. This region repre-
sents in p3 the anterior extension of epithalamus. They develop
nuclear masses functionally related with the stria medullaris
nuclei, which are directed related to habenular nuclei and its
function, as well as dispersed cellular intermingled with axonal
ﬁbers in the telencephalic peduncle (as perireticular and entope-
duncular complex; Wullimann and Muller, 2004), which play
axonal guidance properties of thalamo-cortical projections during
development (Mitrofanis and Baker, 1993; Ulﬁg et al., 2000).
The retromammillary region represents P3 basal plate (Garcia-
Lopez et al., 2004; Figure 3A).
MOLECULAR ORGANIZATION OF THE DIENCEPHALON
Over the last two decades, the discovery of regulatory genes
expressed with regionally restricted patterns in the develop-
ing diencephalon provided experimental results that allowed
to develop causal predictions of the diencephalic organization
(Figures 2 and 3).
At initial stages of mouse forebrain development, diencephalic
regionalization was identiﬁed by the expression of some molec-
ular markers such as Otx2, Six3, or Pax6 (Simeone et al., 1992;
Oliver et al., 1995). After neurulation, the expression of a con-
siderable numbers of genes coding for signaling molecules and
transcription factors reveal the longitudinal and transverse pat-
terning of the diencephalon. In the diencephalic roof plate of
chick and mouse embryos, while Wnt1 is expressed in the dor-
sal midline of pretectum and epithalamus up to the choroidal
plexus tenia (Bach et al., 2003), Wnt8b expression is restricted to
the prethalamic eminence and telencephalic pallium (Parr et al.,
1993). Moreover, in chick embryos, Wnt8b is also expressed in the
ZLI (Garda et al., 2002). In the diencephalic alar plate, Pax6 is
expressed initially throughout the alar forebrain domains, stop-
ping caudally at the p1-mesencephalic boundary (Stoykova and
Gruss, 1994), though its expression is downregulated both in
rostral and caudal epithelium to ZLI (the central diencephalic
organizer that express Shh morphogenetic signal). At later stages,
Pax6 is restricted to the rostral half of the prethalamus and the
caudal pretectum (Figure 3C). In the prethalamus, Dlx genes
were expressed (Figures 2B,G,H; Bulfone et al., 1993). Moreover,
Wnt3a and Fgf15 deﬁnes the entire alar plate of p2 (thalamus
and epithalamus), whereas Gbx2 and Sox14 are expressed in the
thalamic domain but not the epithalamus (Figures 2C,G; Bulfone
et al., 1993; Martinez-de-la-Torre et al., 2002; Gimeno et al., 2003).
The caudal limit of Gbx2 expression domain (Figures 2A,C,G),
together with the AP-2 (Chazaud et al., 1996) and Ebf-1/2/3 (Garel
etal.,1997)geneexpressionsinp1allowstoestablishthemolecular
boundary between p1 and p2. Actually, in zebraﬁsh this boundary
requires Lhx2/9 expression andWnt signaling to develop normally
(Peukert et al., 2011). Nkx2.2 is expressed in the neural epithelium
ﬂanking the expression of Shh and Pitx2 in the ZLI (Figures 2A,G;
Shimamura et al., 1995). Other genes regulated by the expression
of Shh in the diencephalon are Gli genes, coding for transcription
factors and mediating Shh signaling pathway. Gli1, Gli2 (activa-
tors of the Shh pathway), and Gli3 (inhibitor of Shh pathway) are
expressed in the diencephalic alar plate (Figures 2A,F;Hashimoto-
Torii et al., 2003). The homeodomain transcription factor Otx2 is
expressed in the forebrain and midbrain with the caudal limit at
the mid/hindbrain junction (Simeone et al., 1993). Later on dur-
ing development,Otx2 is expressed in the ZLI and in the boundary
between the pretectum and thalamus (Figure 3B).
Finally, basal plate epithelium show some regionally expressed
genes; such as Tcf4, Foxa1, Tle4, Lmx1b, and Ptx2, reveal-
ing speciﬁc molecular domains in the diencephalic tegmen-

THE ZONA LIMITANS
INTRATHALAMICA/MID-DIENCEPHALIC ORGANIZER
Signaling molecules, such as ﬁbroblast growth factor 8 (Fgf8),
Sonic hedgehog (Shh), bone morphogenetic proteins (Bmps2, 4,
6, and 7), Wingless family (Wnts2b, 3a, 5a, and 7a), and retinoic
acid, act as morphogenetic regulatory genes in the developing
diencephalon. These molecules are produced by different dien-
cephalic signaling centers and control the regional expression of
transcription factors that code speciﬁc structural information.

Martinez-Ferre and Martinez
Regulation of diencephalic regionalization
Among all these organizing zones, a central region in the dien-
cephalon seems to be the master-signaling center controlling thal-
amic morphogenesis. This region is known as the ZLI, also called
the mid-diencephalic organizer (MDO) by Scholpp and Lumsden
(2010).
The ZLI is a neuroepithelial domain in the alar plate of the
diencephalon,which separates the prethalamus from the thalamus
(Figures 1 and 2). The ZLI is a conserved diencephalic land-
mark in vertebrate evolution, being described in amniotes and
anamniotes, such as human, mouse, chick, zebraﬁsh, and Xeno-
pus embryos (Scholpp et al., 2006; Vieira et al., 2006; Domínguez
et al., 2010; Gilbert, 2010). Neuroepithelial cells show clonal
restriction inside ZLI territory and low proliferation rate (Puelles
et al., 1987; Martinez and Puelles, 2000; Larsen et al., 2001). The
expression of diverse genes coding for diffusible morphogens at
the ZLI, especially Shh, underlies the current hypothesis that the
ZLI may represent a diencephalic (thalamic) secondary organizer,
which reﬁne the identity and polarity of neighboring neuroep-
ithelial regions (Figure 2; Rubenstein et al., 1994; Puelles et al.,
1996; Nieuwenhuys, 1999; Martinez and Puelles, 2000; Vieira and
Martinez, 2006).
ZONA LIMITANS INTRATHALAMICA: EVIDENCES TO BE AN
ORGANIZING CENTER
The localization of neural organizers often correlates with the
position of neuroepithelial boundaries between morphogenetic
ﬁelds, usually identiﬁed by ventricular ridges in the neural tube,
whichalsorepresentlimitsof intercalativecellmovementsthrough
neuroepithelium (Figdor and Stern, 1993; Martinez and Puelles,
2000; Larsen et al., 2001; Garcia-Lopez et al., 2004). Experimental
observations indicated that a region functions as an organiz-
ing center when it induced a different neuroepithelial fate in
an ectopic neuroepithelial region. Thus, in reference to the IsO,
both, grafting experiments of IsO and implants of the Fgf8 beads,
induced an ectopic and polarized mes-metencephalic fate in chick
embryos, by re-patterning the host neuroepithelium (Crossley
et al., 1996; Martinez et al., 1999; Sato and Joyner, 2009). More-
over, ablations of the isthmus (Irving and Mason, 1999) or genetic
reduction of Fgf8 signal (Chi et al., 2003; Basson et al., 2008) trig-
gered the reduction or the loss of the entire mesencephalon and
rhombencephalon.
However, due to late activation and the dynamic process of Shh
expression in the ZLI, potential inductive properties of ZLI pre-
sumptive territory in host tissue has not been yet observed after
heterotopic transplantation (Vieira et al., 2006), probably because
grafts should be performed in suitable regions and at the correct
developmental stages.
MECHANISMS REGULATING THE SPECIFICATION OF THE
ZLI/GENE EXPRESSION AT THE MID-DIENCEPHALIC
JUNCTION
The cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate the posi-
tioning and induction of Shh expression in the ZLI are not jet
fully understood. However, this aspect could have evolutionary
importance since gene expression differences have been reported
between amniotes and anamniotes. For instance, in chick and
zebraﬁsh embryos, the mechanisms regulating the positioning
and speciﬁcation of the ZLI may be explained by the interaction
between prechordal (Six3 positive) and epichordal (Irx3 positive)
epithelium (Kobayashi et al., 2002; Braun et al., 2003; Scholpp
et al., 2006;Vieira et al., 2006), which is a similar mechanism oper-
ating between Otx2 and Gbx2 at the mid-hindbrain boundary
(Simeone et al., 1992; Wassarman et al., 1997). However, different
molecular interactions should take part in mammals since Six3
activity is not required for the formation of maintenance of the
ZLI (Lavado et al., 2008). In addition, other transcription factors
expressed in the diencephalon,such as Fez/Fezl (in the prethalamic
anlage) and Otx1/2 (in the ZLI and thalamus) have been postu-
lated as necessary for establishing ZLI speciﬁcation (Hirata et al.,
2006; Jeong et al., 2006, 2011; reviewed by Scholpp and Lumsden,
2010). Moreover,we have demonstrated,in chick embryos,that the
expression of Shh in the basal plate is indispensable for the induc-
tion of Shh expression in the ZLI (Vieira and Martinez, 2006). In
contrast, Scholpp et al. (2006) showed, in zebraﬁsh embryos, that
Shh expression remains in the ZLI even in a total absence of Shh
expression in the basal plate, suggesting a potential requirement of
adorsalsignal.Conversely,Shh expressionintheZLIisconstrained
by inhibitory factors derived from the dorsal diencephalon, since
grafts of the dorsal diencephalic tissue inhibits ZLI propagation
(Zeltser, 2005). In contrast to the whole induction of Fgf8 at the
mid-hindbrain boundary, Shh expression in the ZLI is gradually
extended form ventral to dorsal. However, in Fgf8 hypomorphic
embryos, this initial basal activation of a morphogenetic signal in
the IsO is also observed (see Figure 2 in Martinez-Ferre and Mar-
tinez, 2009). This suggests that the tissue closer to the basal plate
is more sensitive to inductive signals or more permissive to the
activation of Fgf8 in the IsO, as it occurs in the ZLI in reference to
Shh expression.
Wnt1 and Fgf8, two secreted factors normally expressed at the
IsO, mediate the morphogenetic activity of the isthmic neuroep-
ithelial region. In the diencephalon, Shh has been demonstrated
as possible effector molecule for the morphogenetic activity of the
ZLI (Vieira et al., 2010) and promotes growth and differentiation
of speciﬁc subdivisions of the thalamus and prethalamus (Vieira
and Martinez, 2006; Szabó et al., 2009; Vue et al., 2009). Vieira
and Martinez (2006) have demonstrated that Shh from the ZLI is
necessary for nuclear organization in the diencephalon. Moreover,
it is possible that other signaling molecules expressed in the ZLI or
near this region, such as Fgf8 (Kataoka and Shimogori, 2008) or
different Wnts (Wnt1, Wnt8b, Wnt3, and/or Wnt3a; Braun et al.,
2003; Walshe and Mason, 2003; Garcia-Lopez et al., 2004; Quin-
lan et al., 2009), could be important for the diencephalic nuclear
organization and cell survival (Mattes et al., 2012). In fact, Wnt
family members, such as Wnt1 and Wnt8b are strong candidates
for rostral patterning of the early neural plate in chick embryos
(Chapman et al., 2004). Among them, Wnt8b is detected in the
diencephalic alar plate in chick embryos at HH10 (Garda et al.,
2002; Garcia-Lopez et al., 2004). Later in development, Wnt8b
expression in the diencephalon generates a wedge-shaped area,
ﬂanked by lunatic-fringe (L-fng) expression domains in the dien-
cephalon (Larsen et al., 2001; Zeltser et al., 2001; Kiecker and
Lumsden, 2005). Since Wnt8b expression in the ZLI is prior to
Shh expression in this diencephalic region, it suggests that Wnt8b
could be an indicator of the deﬁnitive ZLI localization. Altogether,

Regulation of diencephalic regionalization
we can conclude that the formation of the ZLI is regulated by
multiple molecular and cellular factors.
TOWARD AN INTEGRATIVE VIEW ON THALAMUS
DEVELOPMENT AND ORGANIZATION
The evolution of the brain occurs by neural changes that allow a
group of organisms to develop a complex behavior and interact
with the world in a unique way. Evolution is achieved through
subsequent ontogenetic changes over times, which include mod-
iﬁcations of some of the mechanisms involved during vertebrate
brain development. Despite these inter-speciﬁc differences in
brain development, basic conservative mechanisms during brain
development are present in different vertebrate species to regu-
late similar developmental processes. In this review, diencephalic
anatomy and some interactions between different signaling mole-
cules and transcription factors in diencephalic development have
been analyzed, as a basic platform to get inside thalamic structural
and functional complexity.
