The diencephalon, an integral component of the forebrain, governs a spectrum
of crucial functions, ranging from sensory processing to emotional regulation.
Yet, unraveling its unique development, intricate connectivity, and its role in
neurodevelopmental disorders has long been hampered by the scarcity of
human brain tissue and ethical constraints. Recent advancements in stem cell
technology, particularly the emergence of brain organoids, have heralded a new
era in neuroscience research. Although most brain organoid methodologies
have hitherto concentrated on directing stem cells toward telencephalic fates,
novel techniques now permit the generation of region-speciﬁc brain organoids
that faithfully replicate precise diencephalic identities. These models mirror the
complexity of the human diencephalon, providing unprecedented opportunities
for investigating diencephalic development, functionality, connectivity, and
pathophysiology in vitro. This review summarizes the development, function, and
connectivity of diencephalic structures and touches upon developmental brain
disorders linked to diencephalic abnormalities. Furthermore, it presents current
diencephalic organoid models and their applications in unraveling the intricacies
of diencephalic development, function, and pathology in humans. Lastly, it
highlights thalamocortical assembloid models, adept at capturing human-
speciﬁc aspects of thalamocortical connections, along with their relevance in
neurodevelopmental disorders.

1 Introduction
The study of the human brain with its intricate complexities has always been at the
front line of scientiﬁc exploration. However, understanding the development, function,
and pathology of the human brain presents a formidable challenge, primarily due to the
diﬃculty of acquiring human tissue for research and ethical considerations. Recent strides
in stem cell technology have addressed these challenges with a groundbreaking solution:
brain organoids, three-dimensional (3D) models of the human brain grown in vitro from
pluripotent stem cells (Lancaster et al., 2013; Di Lullo and Kriegstein, 2017; Velasco et al.,
2020). As a new research model, brain organoids swiftly carved out a distinct niche, oﬀering
unique opportunities to study the complex aspects of human brain development, structure,
function, and disease that are not accessible in animal models.

Two approaches have been utilized in generating brain
organoids: guided and unguided methods. Guided methods,
which are used to generate organoids collectively known as
region-speciﬁc brain organoids, encompass techniques of directed
diﬀerentiation involving intentional manipulation of the cellular
environment. These approaches entail adding speciﬁc growth
factors, signaling molecules, or genetic modiﬁcations to steer cells
along a predetermined developmental trajectory. Brain organoids
generated by guided methods faithfully recapitulate both the
developmental process and functions of a speciﬁc brain region. In
contrast, unguided methods rely on spontaneous diﬀerentiation,
allowing organoids to develop without direct manipulation.
Cultured within an environment that supports self-organization,
these organoids exhibit diverse cell types and structures akin to the
human brain during embryonic development. However, although
brain organoids generated with unguided methods capture the
natural complexity and cellular diversity of the developing human
brain, they lack the precise developmental control necessary to
study speciﬁc brain regions or cell types. Conversely, guided
methods enable targeted investigation of the development and
function of a speciﬁc brain region (Qian et al., 2019; Mayhew and
Singhania, 2022; Susaimanickam et al., 2022).
Brain development begins early in embryogenesis and involves
tightly coordinated signaling cascades and cellular dynamics. Upon
gastrulation, the neural plate emerges and undergoes specialization
into distinct progenitor domains, each destined to contribute to
the major brain regions such as telencephalon, diencephalon,
mesencephalon, metencephalon, and myelencephalon (Stiles and
Jernigan, 2010). The shaping of these structures relies on
organizers releasing morphogens in a precise spatiotemporal
manner to pattern the neural tube along the dorsal-ventral and
anterior-posterior axes (Wilson and Maden, 2005; Sansom and
Livesey, 2009; Kiecker and Lumsden, 2012). In recent years,
several methods have emerged, enabling the manipulation of
human pluripotent stem cells to generate region-speciﬁc brain
organoids that recapitulate these developmental processes in vitro.
These organoids encompass various types, including cortical and
hippocampal organoids representing telencephalic fate, midbrain
organoids derived from mesencephalic fate, and thalamic organoids
emulating the diencephalic fate, among others (Jo et al., 2016;
Xiang et al., 2017, 2019; Cakir et al., 2019; Qian et al., 2020;
Kim et al., 2023b; Kiral et al., 2023). In this mini-review, we
will summarize the development, function, and connectivity of
the main structures in the diencephalon in both healthy and
pathological conditions. Additionally, we will discuss the current
models of diencephalic organoids and their use in understanding
the development, connectivity, and pathology of the human
diencephalon.
2 The diencephalon and
neurodevelopmental disorders
2.1 Development and functions of the
diencephalic structures
During early embryogenesis, the diencephalon originates from
the prosencephalon, a segment of the developing neural tube that
forms the forebrain. Following gastrulation, the prosencephalon
undergoes a series of morphological transformations, eventually
splitting into the telencephalon anteriorly and the diencephalon
posteriorly. The telencephalon contributes to the formation of
the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and basal ganglia, whereas the
diencephalon gives rise to the structures, including the pretectum,
thalamus, epithalamus, and prethalamus (Jessell and Sanes, 2000;
Colas and Schoenwolf, 2001). Over the past century, embryologists
have proposed two contrasting models to elucidate the fundamental
principles of forebrain development, both sharing a common
feature: the concept that development occurs through neighboring
modules or independent units. On the one hand, the columnar
model, initially introduced by Herrick in 1910 and later expanded
upon by Alvarez-Bolado et al. in 1995, posits that the forebrain’s
core components are organized as longitudinal columns along the
dorsal-ventral axis. According to this model, the diencephalon is
situated between the telencephalon in the rostral direction and
the mesencephalon (midbrain) in the caudal direction, and it
is further divided into four segments, progressing from dorsal
to ventral: the epithalamus, thalamus, ventral thalamus, and
hypothalamus (Herrick, 1910; Alvarez-Bolado et al., 1995). On
the other hand, the prosomeric model, originally proposed by
Bergquist in 1932 and later reﬁned by Puelles and Rubenstein in
2003, oﬀers an alternative perspective. This model interprets the
division of the diencephalon into functional units based on distinct
anatomical regions and gene expression patterns, establishing itself
as a widely accepted framework for comprehending forebrain
development (Bergquist, 1932; Puelles and Rubenstein, 2003).
The prosomeric model places emphasis on the anterior-posterior
patterning and segmentation of the diencephalon, dividing it into
three primary prosomeres. Prosomere 1 (p1) matures into the
pretectum that is primarily responsible for controlling functions
related to eye movement and visual coordination (Gamlin, 2006).
Prosomere 2 (p2) develops dorsally into the epithalamus, housing
structures like the habenula and pineal gland, and ventrally
to the thalamus. The habenula connects to the midbrain and
plays vital roles in reward signaling, whereas the pineal gland is
specialized as a neuroendocrine organ producing the hormone
melatonin and participates in daily and seasonal circadian rhythm
regulation (Klein, 2004; Hikosaka, 2010; Sapede and Cau, 2013).
The thalamus, with a diverse set of functionally distinct nuclei,
serves as the main relay station for sensory information from
peripheral sensory organs to various cortical areas (Lopez-Bendito
and Molnar, 2003; Nakagawa, 2019). Lastly, prosomere 3 (p3)
gives rise to the prethalamus, with the most prominent structure
called the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). The TRN, a sheet
of inhibitory GABAergic neurons situated between the thalamus
and cortex, modulates thalamic and cortical inputs, regulating
attention, arousal, sensory and motor integration, and network
oscillations (McAlonan et al., 2006; Halassa et al., 2011; Marlinski
et al., 2012). In this review, we will adhere to the prosomeric
model, which delineates the hypothalamus as distinct from the
diencephalon. Therefore, discussions related to the hypothalamus
and its organoids will not be featured in this review (Qian et al.,
2016; Huang et al., 2021).
According
to
the

model,
the
diencephalon
undergoes division through dorso-ventral and anterior-posterior
patterning, creating discrete progenitor domains. This partitioning
is orchestrated by an interplay of morphogen gradients and

signaling molecules that collaboratively establish unique gene
expression patterns and the subsequent fate of the cells within
these speciﬁc territories. Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) stands out as the
key signaling molecule recognized for its role in generating diverse
identities within the diencephalon. Shh is not solely produced
in the ventral part, the ﬂoor plate of the diencephalon, but is
also released from a transverse band that emerges between the
thalamus (p2) and prethalamus (p3), known as the zona limitans
intrathalamica (ZLI) (Kiecker and Lumsden, 2004). Graded Shh
signaling originating from both the ﬂoor plate and the ZLI plays
a pivotal role in shaping distinct domains within p2. In regions
proximal to the sources of Shh, a smaller area is speciﬁed as the
rostral thalamus (Th-r), while a larger region, exposed to lower
Shh levels, is speciﬁed as the caudal thalamus (Th-c). Likewise,
the p3 region receives high levels of Shh, particularly deﬁning
the TRN (Figure 1A). Progenitor cells exposed to high Shh levels
in the prospective Th-r and TRN subsequently diﬀerentiate into
GABAergic inhibitory neurons, while those in the prospective Th-c
primarily diﬀerentiate into excitatory glutamatergic neurons. This
initial determination of cell fate later inﬂuences the connectivity
of inhibitory and excitatory nuclei. Excitatory neurons in the Th-
c project to various cortical regions, whereas inhibitory neurons
in the Th-r and TRN establish connections with the excitatory
thalamic nuclei but not with the cortex (Hashimoto-Torii et al.,
2003; Vue et al., 2009; Jeong et al., 2011). A recent analysis of single-
cell transcriptomics of the human thalamus revealed a notable
increase in both the quantity and diversity of GABAergic neurons.
These neurons originate from ganglionic eminences and migrate
to the thalamus during the second trimester of the development.
Further comparative studies are needed to determine whether
these GABAergic neurons are speciﬁc to humans and how they
contribute to the functional organization of thalamic nuclei and
their connectivity to the cortex (Kim et al., 2023a).
The dorsal-most part of the developing diencephalon, known
as the roof plate, expresses the members of TGF-β and FGF
superfamilies, including Bmp7, Bmp4, Wnt family members,
and Fgf8 (Dickinson and McMahon, 1992; Crossley and Martin,
1995; Shimamura and Rubenstein, 1997; Lee and Jessell, 1999;
Hagemann and Scholpp, 2012). In mice, the absence of Wnt/β-
catenin signaling in the developing diencephalon leads to ectopic
induction of prethalamic (Dlx2, Dlx5, Dlx6, and Islet1) and Th-r
markers (Helt, Gata2, and Gata3) in the presumptive Th-c region
suggesting that it is required for the emergence and maintenance
of the Th-c thalamic identity (Bluske et al., 2009). Likewise, the
downregulation of Fgf8 results in a decrease in Gbx2 expression
within the Th-c region, which is likely to impact the diﬀerentiation
of glutamatergic neurons and their connections to the cortex.
Intriguingly, this downregulation also leads to the near absence
of epithalamic nuclei, including the habenula and pineal gland
(Martinez-Ferre and Martinez, 2009; Schmidt and Pasterkamp,
2017). In short, the dynamic interplay of these signaling pathways
not only shapes the initial patterning of diencephalic structures but
also lays the foundation for its multifaceted functions, from sensory
processing to circadian rhythm regulation.
2.2 Diencephalic abnormalities in
neurodevelopmental disorders
The thalamus is the most prominent and well-characterized
part of the diencephalon. In development, the thalamus establishes
connections with multiple cortical areas involved in key functions
like processing sensory inputs, controlling sleep cycles, and
forming memories. This expansive thalamocortical connectivity
allows the thalamus to relay and modulate information ﬂow
between subcortical structures and the cortex. Given its critical
roles, abnormalities in the development of thalamic nuclei
and their cortical projections can lead to neurodevelopmental
and psychiatric disorders. Among these, conditions such as
schizophrenia (SCZ), autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and
bipolar disorder (BP) have seen growing associations with
developmental and functional irregularities in thalamocortical
networks, which have been correlated with clinical outcomes (Chen
et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2021; Hwang et al., 2022). Numerous
studies have reported reduced thalamic volume in individuals
with SCZ. Post-mortem examinations have revealed not only

a reduction in gray matter volume within diﬀerent thalamic
nuclei but also diminished ﬁber density and myelination in the
white matter pathways connecting these thalamic nuclei to the
prefrontal cortex. These ﬁndings collectively suggest impaired
connectivity between the thalamus and cortex in SCZ patients
(Danos et al., 2003; Kito et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2019; Zhang et al.,
2021). Intriguingly, SCZ also seems to be linked to disturbances
in TRN function. One of the critical roles of the TRN is to
generate and modulate sleep spindles within the thalamocortical
network, a process that shows reduced activity in individuals with
SCZ (Ferrarelli et al., 2007; Manoach et al., 2016; Thankachan
et al., 2019). While many studies have focused on schizophrenia,
emerging research using neuroimaging and genomics has found
shared thalamocortical circuit abnormalities across a range of
psychiatric disorders. Functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) and genetic analysis have revealed common disruptions
in communications between the thalamus and cortex in patients
with diseases such as BP, major depression, and attention-deﬁcit
hyperactivity disorders (ADHD) (Nair et al., 2013; Tu et al., 2019;
Elvsashagen et al., 2021). These ﬁndings suggest that examining
shared thalamic connectivity defects could provide insights into
mechanisms underlying a variety of neuropsychiatric illnesses.
The dorsal part of the diencephalon harbors the epithalamic
structures, notably the habenula and pineal gland. The habenula
receives input and integrates information from limbic structures
and the basal ganglia and, in turn, sends outputs to various
midbrain structures where dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-
HT) neurons are located (Hikosaka et al., 2008; Boulos et al.,
2017). Given its connections, the habenula plays a signiﬁcant
role in diverse physiological processes and social behaviors,
including reward processing, regulation of circadian rhythms, and
decision-making (Nuno-Perez et al., 2021; Lalive et al., 2022;
Salaberry and Mendoza, 2022). Eventually, dysregulation of the
habenula is linked to several psychiatric disorders (Germann et al.,
2021; Murru et al., 2021; Sonkusare et al., 2022). While mood
disorders like major depressive disorder (MDD) typically emerge
during adulthood, they have displayed a consistent association
with increased neuronal activity within the habenula (Browne
et al., 2018; Aizawa and Zhu, 2019; Gold and Kadriu, 2019).
Both pharmacological inhibition and electrical stimulation of the
habenula have shown the capacity to mitigate MDD-like behaviors
in animal models (Meng et al., 2011; Winter et al., 2011; Tchenio
et al., 2017). In a recent study, deep-brain stimulation of the
habenula has exhibited promise in alleviating symptoms among
individuals with MDD (Wang et al., 2020). Emerging ﬁndings
also point to the potential involvement of the pineal gland, the
other epithalamic structure, in ASD. This connection was initially
identiﬁed when individuals with ASD exhibited notably low levels
of serum melatonin (Sumida et al., 1996). Subsequent research has
indicated the beneﬁcial impact of administering external melatonin
in alleviating symptoms associated with ASD, including sleep
disturbances, anxiety, as well as deﬁcits in learning and spatial
memory (Baydas et al., 2005; Olcese et al., 2009; Tian et al., 2014).
In summary, abnormalities in the development and function of
diverse diencephalic structures could potentially play a role in the
etiology of several neurodevelopmental disorders. Ongoing and
future research will provide deeper insights into the connections
between diencephalic dysfunction and these disorders.
3 Diencephalic organoids and
neurodevelopmental disorders
Brain organoids derived from pluripotent stem cells have
emerged
as
valuable
tools
for
investigating
human
brain
development
and
disorders.
Nevertheless,
the
majority
of
research eﬀorts, until recently, have focused on creating organoids
resembling the telencephalon. This focus largely emanated from
the telencephalon’s direct implication in numerous brain disorders,
while the precise emulation of other forebrain regions, notably
the diencephalon, remained relatively unexplored until recent
advancements. The pioneering work to generate organoids
resembling the diencephalon was spearheaded by the Sasai group.
Their approach involved exposing mouse embryonic stem cells
(mESCs) to low concentrations of caudalization factor insulin and
an inhibitor for MAPK/ERK kinase, which eﬀectively enhanced
the expression of early diencephalic markers, speciﬁcally Otx2
and Pax6. Moreover, they found that BMP7, which is expressed
in thalamic primordium, promoted the emergence of thalamic
progenitors expressing Tcf7l2, Gbx2, and Olig3. Notably, when
these diencephalic organoids were transplanted into subcortical
regions of mice, the thalamic neurons within them displayed
a propensity to extend their axons to cortical layers, closely
mirroring their behavior in the in vivo context (Shiraishi et al.,
2017). Building upon this foundation, Xiang et al. (2019) applied a
similar methodology using human embryonic stem cells (hESCs),
successfully generating brain organoids resembling the human
thalamus (Figure 1B). Their single-cell RNA sequencing analysis
revealed the formation of distinct thalamic lineages marked by the
expression of thalamic transcription factors Tcf7l2, Pax6, and Gbx2
(Xiang et al., 2019). A shared feature between these studies was the
nearly uniform development of glutamatergic, excitatory thalamic
neurons inside the organoids, represented by the expression
of vGLUT2. This suggests that both methods eﬀectively guide
embryonic stem cells toward a caudal thalamic fate characterized
by the emergence of excitatory neurons projecting to the cortex
(Shiraishi et al., 2017; Xiang et al., 2019).
While the caudal thalamus is primarily composed of excitatory
neurons projecting to various cortical areas, the rostral thalamus
and prethalamus are predominantly populated by GABAergic
inhibitory neurons. These inhibitory neurons establish connections
with the caudal thalamic region but do not extend their projections
to the cortex (Ferrarelli and Tononi, 2011). In an eﬀort to
expand the toolbox for diencephalic organoids, our group recently
developed a method to generate ventralized thalamic organoids
(vThOs) exploiting SHH treatment on an already established
thalamic organoid generation protocol (Xiang et al., 2019; Kiral
et al., 2023). We discovered that SHH treatment between days
14 and 22 in culture particularly induced the expression of
prethalamic markers, including Dlx2, Lhx1, and Lhx5. In contrast
to previously generated thalamic organoids, vThOs predominantly
comprise GABAergic inhibitory neurons. These neurons express
canonical TRN markers such as Spp1 and Ecel1, a nucleus
derived
from
the
prethalamus.
Intriguingly,
transplantation
experiments unveiled distinct connectivity patterns: ESC-derived
SPP1- thalamic neurons projected to the cortex, while SPP1 + TRN
neurons established local connections within the thalamus,
mirroring the connectivity preferences observed in in vivo TRN

neurons (Ferrarelli and Tononi, 2011). Due to its modulatory
role in thalamocortical communication, TRN dysfunction has been
linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and
schizophrenia (Halassa et al., 2014; Thankachan et al., 2019). To
test whether vThOs could serve as a model for studying TRN-
related disorders, we perturbed two TRN-enriched disease risk
genes, PTCHD1 and ERBB4 (Ahrens et al., 2015; Wells et al.,
2016). Although loss-of-function of these genes did not interfere
with GABAergic neural diﬀerentiation and TRN speciﬁcation in
vThOs, they led to a signiﬁcant decrease in neural activity. These
ﬁndings align with similar observations made in animal models
and underscore the value of vThOs as a reliable in vitro model
for probing human TRN development and function under both
healthy and pathological conditions.
Reciprocal connections between the caudal thalamus and
cortex are integral to processes such as sensory and motor
function, attention, and arousal (Lopez-Bendito and Molnar, 2003).
While extensive research has been conducted on the development
and function of thalamocortical (TC) and corticothalamic (CT)
connections in rodent models, exploring uniquely human aspects
of these connections has only become achievable recently. This
progress has been made possible through the fusion of human
thalamic and cortical organoids, collectively termed “assembloids.”
Xiang et al. (2019) were the ﬁrst to establish an in vitro
thalamocortical connectivity model by fusing thalamic and cortical
organoids. Upon fusion, thalamic axons preferentially projected
to putative cortical plate-like regions where newly born cortical
neurons are located, resembling the TC targeting in developing
brain in vivo. Intriguingly, once fused with cortical organoids,
thalamic neurons demonstrated the presence of synchronized
neural activity, suggesting network-level connections in this
assembloid model (Xiang et al., 2019) (Figure 1B). Recently,
Kim et al. (2023b) utilized thalamo-cortical assembloids to
model developmental defects linked to the voltage-gated calcium
channel Cav3.1, encoded by CACNA1G, which is enriched in
the thalamus (Figure 1C). They demonstrated that a gain-of-
function CACNA1G variant, previously tied to absence seizures
in animal epilepsy models, led to hypersynchronous ﬁring of
both thalamic and cortical neurons in the assembloid system
(Kunii et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2023b). In contrast, loss of
CACNA1G, associated with schizophrenia, promoted overgrown
thalamic projections and increased asynchronous spontaneous
activity (Singh et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2023b). Overall, these
pioneering studies highlight the potential of thalamo-cortical
assembloids to uncover human-speciﬁc features of thalamocortical
development and provide platforms to elucidate how thalamus-
speciﬁc neurodevelopmental insults can disturb thalamo-cortical
wiring and dynamics underlying neurological disorders.
4 Conclusion and future directions
Brain organoid systems have rapidly advanced capabilities to
model distinct regions and cell types of the developing human
brain. Recent progress in diencephalic organoids provides exciting
new platforms to investigate spatiotemporal organization and
circuit wiring of human diencephalic structures in physiological
and disease states. Still, continued eﬀorts to generate more
intricate diencephalic structures and physiologically relevant
assembloid models are needed. Similar to our work to generate
diencephalic organoids with thalamic reticular nucleus identity,
future works may exploit a combination of various signaling
molecules to generate in vitro models for other diencephalic
structures such as pretectum and epithalamus. Additionally, the
current thalamo-cortical assembloid models could be improved by
incorporating other essential components of the thalamocortical
circuit, such as GABAergic neurons of the thalamic reticular
nucleus and corridor cells of the lateral ganglionic eminence. Given
that the thalamus receives sensory input from various sensory
organs, incorporating sensory cells into assembloid models could
further elevate their physiological relevance. Finally, similar to
cortical organoids that fail to demonstrate arealization, thalamic
organoids lack the formation of nuclei that are known to
connect diﬀerent cortical areas. Future studies need to explore
methods to generate such organoids encompassing distinct nuclei,
which is imperative to model nuclei-speciﬁc connectivity between
the thalamus and cortex in vitro. In summary, diencephalic
organoids represent a rapidly evolving ﬁeld that oﬀers unique
opportunities to deepen our understanding of human diencephalon
development, function, and dysfunction. Continued reﬁnement
of diencephalic organoid systems will expand our capabilities for
investigating the origins and potential therapies for a range of
neurodevelopmental disorders.
