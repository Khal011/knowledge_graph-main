Pritz Department of Neurological Surgery, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Ind. , USA noted further parcellation of the synencephalon into an an- terior and posterior component, whereas others have not. Notwithstanding differe nces as to whether the synencepha- lon is a single unit or not, these detailed analyses in reptiles (Alligator) , birds (chick), and mammals (humans), suggest that the initial pattern of early diencephalon development in amniotes is similar.
